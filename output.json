    "text": "Civil liberties group urges Washington to cancel programme to prevent ‘slide into anti-immigrant dystopia’\nThe US is testing robotic patrol dogs along its frontier with Mexico that it says could provide “mechanical reinforcements”\nfor border guards, in a move criticised by a leading domestic rights group as a “civil liberties disaster”.\nAdding to the outcry, the company that developed the dogs, Ghost Robotics, has previously showcased a four-legged robot that\nhas a sniper rifle attached to its back.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said this week that its research and development arm had offered border guards\n“a helping hand (or ‘paw’)” to work to “force-multiply” patrols.\n“Due to the demands of the region, adding quadruped mechanical reinforcements is a smart use of resources,” the DHS said in a blog post.\nGavin Kenneally, the chief operating officer at Ghost Robotics, said the unarmed 45kg robot dog was “bred” to walk on sand,\nrocks and hills, as well as human-built environments such as stairs.\nThe robots were tested in El Paso, Texas, on the international border. “In a desert area, the dogs were programmed to go on\nsimulated sentry duty,” DHS said.\nIt suggested that the bulky metal robots could even be used “as cover” for border guards.\n“Just like anywhere else, you have your standard criminal behaviour, but along the border you can also have human smuggling,\ndrug smuggling, as well as smuggling of other contraband – including firearms or even potentially, [weapons of mass destruction],”\nagent Brett Becker, of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) innovation team, was quoted as saying.\nFederal agents operating along the Mexican border have long been accused of misconduct and mistreatment of the migrants and\nasylum seekers attempting to enter the US. Joe Biden’s administration has been sharply criticised by refugee advocates for the\ngrowing number of immigrants being held at private facilities.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union warned on Thursday that Washington’s plan to use robot patrol dogs on its borders was “a civil\nliberties disaster in the making”.\n“The government must retract this dangerous proposal, and the Biden administration must put the brakes on our country’s slide\ninto an anti-immigrant dystopia,” the advocacy group said.\nIn its post, DHS said people should not be “surprised if in the future we see robot ‘Fido’ out in the field, walking\nside-by-side with [CBP] personnel”.",

    "text": "China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as key to upgrading military strength, solving problems created by a\nshrinking workforce, and a source of national pride\nOn a misty Saturday afternoon in Shenzhen’s Central Park, a gaggle of teenage girls are sheltering from the drizzle under\na concrete canopy. With their bags of crisps piled high in front of them, they crowd around a couple of smartphones\nto sing along to Mandopop ballads. The sound of their laughter rings out across the surrounding lawn – until it is\npierced by a mechanical buzzing sound. Someone has ordered dinner.\nA few metres away from the impromptu karaoke session is an “airdrop cabinet”, one of more than 40 in Shenzhen that is\noperated by Meituan, China’s biggest food delivery platform. Hungry park-goers can order anything from rice noodles to\nSubway sandwiches to bubble tea.\nA drone, loaded up with goods from a shopping mall less than three kilometres away, flies into view, and earshot,\nhovering over the delivery station for a moment, before steadily lowering and depositing the goods into a sealed box\nthat can only be unlocked by entering the customer’s phone number. Dinner is served with not a human in sight.\nMeituan aims to beat human delivery times by about 10%, although perhaps because of its journey whizzing through\nthe clouds in a thin polystyrene box, the food, char siu pork and a waffle, is slightly cold.\nThe drones are a small part of the broader robotics and artificial intelligence industry that China is intent on\nexpanding on this year.\nWith a trade war raging, demographic challenges dragging on the economy and the prospect of a productive relationship\nwith the world’s largest economy looking ever more remote, Beijing is doubling down on the industries where it sees the\npotential – and the need – to develop ahead of the US. China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as being the key to\nupgrading its military strength, solving the problems created by a shrinking workforce, and a source of national pride –\nespecially when Chinese firms manage to circumvent US-led sanctions on core technology. And technology firms, for many\nyears shunned by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as he sought to crack down on excessive wealth and influence outside the Chinese\nCommunist party’s control, are being welcomed back into the fold as Xi seeks to restore confidence in the private sector and\nencourage domestic innovation.\nIn March, Premier Li Qiang promised to “unleash the creativity of the digital economy”, with a particular focus on\n“embodied AI”. Guangdong, which includes the tech hub of Shenzhen, is at the forefront of this movement. The\nprovincial government recently announced 60m yuan (£6.4m) in new funding for innovation centres. Shenzhen in\nparticular is known as China’s drone capital, because of the authorities’ progressive approach to drone regulations,\nallowing the “low altitude economy” to develop faster than in other parts of the country. China’s Civil Aviation\nAdministration predicts that the value of the sector will increase five-fold to 3.5tn yuan in the next decade.\nIt is not just drones that are promising – or threatening – to upend the tempo of urban life in China. Humanoid\nrobots are particularly buzzy. The highlight of this year’s Spring festival gala, which was viewed nearly 17bn\ntimes, was a dance performed by a troupe of humanoid robots made by a company called Unitree. On Saturday, the\nworld’s first humanoid v human race – a half marathon – took place on the outskirts of Beijing.\n“Applying artificial intelligence to robots basically really kicked into high gear last year,” says Rui Ma, a\nChina technology analyst and investor based in San Francisco. The shift could allow the industry to grow at a\nmuch faster rate in 2025 than in previous years. Reinforcement learning, which means training robots to learn from\nexperience rather than relying on rigid models, allows humanoid robots to be trained in months rather than years,\nhastening the pace of innovation. Toy robot dogs are already part of daily life in China. At a wholesale market in\nYiwu, a trading hub in east China’s Zhejiang province, a child plays with a robot dog while his mother haggles with\nexporters over the price of false eyelashes. On the streets of Shanghai, a woman walks her robot dog, which is helpfully\ncarrying a basket of shopping on its back.\nThe development of China’s robotics industry is intimately linked to advances in AI. For years, China has been\ntrying to catch up with the United States. Xi wants to drive economic growth through “new quality productive forces”,\na concept that includes advanced technologies.\nMany in Washington fear that the US’s lead is narrowing. One major tool in the US’s arsenal has been its control over\nthe important parts of the supply chain for semiconductors, the microchips used to train advanced AI models. The US\nrestricts the export of the most sophisticated chips to China, part of a strategy described by former national security\nadviser Jake Sullivan as “high fence” around the US’s most strategically valuable technology.\nBut in January, a previously unknown Chinese firm called DeepSeek set the Chinese tech scene alight with the release of\na large language reasoning model, R1, which performs as well as leading US competitors, at a fraction of the price. The\nmodel sparked a stock market crash, with $1tn wiped off Wall Street’s leading tech index as investors feared that the US’s\npole position in the tech race was no longer guaranteed.\n“You can’t really overemphasise how crazy of a moment that was,” says Ma.\nSince then, China’s AI industry has been brimming with optimism. It was already being promoted by the government as the\nanswer to China’s long term, sustainable growth, and now, says Ma, the public has started to believe it too.\nLi Shuhao, a tech entrepreneur based in Guangzhou who founded an AI marketing company, Tec-Do, in 2017, was in the United\nStates when the DeepSeek moment happened. All of a sudden, “it was way easier for me to arrange interviews and arrange meetings\nwith other AI scientists,” he says.\n“DeepSeek is kind of a symbol for the Oriental way of doing business,” says Li, a self-confessed “metalhead”, surrounded by electric\nguitars and a drum kit in his office in Guangzhou. He is referring to the strategy pursued by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s founder,\nof financing it through his own hedge fund rather than seeking external venture capital funding. “This is how typical Chinese\nentrepreneurs think. Just survive first, then do something new.”\nDeepSeek published its work as open source, a principle that the government has long favoured and a move which has encouraged\nwidespread adoption of its model. Robotics has been a particular beneficiary.\nPutting tech first\nThe robotics supply chain can loosely be divided into three areas: the brain, the body, and the application of the technology\nin the real world. China has long been confident in its ability in the latter two areas – advanced supply chains in other hi-tech\nindustries such as electric vehicles and autonomous drones show that China has both the capacity to produce industrial components\nat scale and the knowhow to assemble them into complex goods. But solving the trickiest part of the puzzle, making a robot brain\nthat can learn human-like behaviours and movements, has been elusive. It requires sophisticated AI.\nDeepSeek’s R1 model changed the game, paving a way for domestic humanoid robotics companies to catch up with overseas competitors,\nsaid analysts at Goldman Sachs in a recent note. The fact that DeepSeek’s open-source model uses less advanced chips helps level the\nplaying field for Chinese companies.\nThe industry is still fraught with challenges. Any AI model requires reams of data for training. While LLMs used for things like\nchatbots can draw upon the vast universe of content that is the internet, the data for robotic AI models, such as information on\nhow to physically move through space and interact with objects or people, is relatively scarce.\nIn the world of autonomous vehicles, another sector that China is focusing on, a car needs to be able to navigate through six axes,\nor “degrees of freedom”: forwards and backwards, left and right, up and down, and the rotations between these positions. The same\ngoes for general robotics, such as Meituan’s food delivery drones. For a humanoid robot to be able to mimic a human in everyday\ntasks, such as cooking, it needs up to 60 degrees of freedom. Unitree’s H1 model that caused a splash at the Spring Gala has 27.\nRobots don’t need to be fully humanoid to be useful. Robots on wheels or humanoids with limited motion can still take on tasks\nthat are ripe for automation, such as dangerous or repetitive factory jobs. UBTech, a Shenzhen-based company, already supplies\nhumanoid robots to car factories. With a shrinking workforce, China is keen to find ways to automate wherever possible.\nAt last month’s Boao Forum for Asia, a business conference, organisers were keen to dish out jianbing, a savoury pancake that\nis a typical Chinese street food, made by a robotic arm in a booth, similar to the claws that collect stuffed toys in an arcade\n(the resulting snack was not as crispy as a human-made offering). Parks in Beijing have ramped up their surveillance abilities by\nsticking cameras on autonomous buggies which drive along the paths.\n“Robots are not replacing the vast majority of the labour force,” says Amber Zhang, a product manager at BigOne Lab, a Beijing-based\ndata intelligence firm. “For instance, if you look at robot taxis, how many cab drivers are actually getting replaced? There are still\na lot of hurdles”.\nIn a handful of cities across China, the tech company Baidu operates fleets of autonomous taxis, called Apollo Go, or\nrobotaxis. But a recent attempt by the Guardian to hail a ride in Shenzhen was foiled twice: the robotaxis only operate\nin one district of the city, and when the Guardian tried to order one there, the wait was nearly 20 minutes before the app\napologised and said that none could be found. A human-driven taxi turned up within four minutes. Robocops, touted by state\nmedia as a way of beefing up Shenzhen’s security apparatus, are nowhere to be seen.\nBut it’s undeniable that the narrative has shifted. With other sectors of China’s economy facing significant challenges – exports\nare under pressure from tariffs; consumer demand remains weak – the government is keen to back a winning horse. “Now that real estate\nis no longer a source of revenue for many local governments, they have to attract good companies and support what they are doing,” Zhang says.\nThe story of technology underpinning growth “is clicking for people,” says Ma, “and it’s also partly because, where else can then invest?”\nThat is a marked shift from just a few years ago, when tech bosses were pushed to the sidelines as Xi cracked down on excessive wealth\nand influence in the private sector. The sudden cancellation in 2020 of an IPO by Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, sent a chill\nthrough the technology and finance sectors, as did the fall from grace of Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma.\nBut Ma was recently invited to a rare in-person meeting with Xi, along with other tech bosses including DeepSeek’s Liang, as Xi\ntried show that tech entrepreneurs are back in fashion.\nSuch meetings “give us confidence” says Li. “Maybe the bad time has ended”.",

    "text": "Robots praised by New York mayor for searching ruins of a parking garage collapse, but critics fear robots will collect private data\n“Digidog is out of the pound,” Eric Adams declared in April. The New York City mayor also insisted the successful use of the\ncontroversial robot in response to a recent building collapse should convince critics such devices can improve safety in the city.\nAdams commended first responders’ use of the four-legged robot in the ruins of a parking garage collapse last week in Manhattan,\nin which one person was killed and five injured.\nFirst responders used the robot to search the rubble while safety concerns about the building’s structure persisted.\n“Some people call them toys,” Adams told reporters. “This is not playtime. This is real time. And this is an administration that\nis not going to be fearful of using everything possible to save the lives of New Yorkers and to save the lives of first responders.”\nCritics said the use of such robots in the building collapse response did not negate legitimate concerns about the use of robots\nfor surveillance and aggressive policing.\nDonna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the New York Times: “While deploying a robot is,\nof course, appropriate in situations like this, that doesn’t eliminate the need for transparency about this and other technologies\nthat may have the capacity to engage in massive surveillance and routinely collect massive amounts of private personal data on\nmillions of New Yorkers.”\nCritics also noted that it was not clear how useful the Digidog was in the building collapse response.\n“I want to believe that these robots would be effective in a building collapse,” Albert Fox Cahn, an attorney and executive\ndirector of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told the Times. “But we need more than a couple of soundbites.”\nAdams began rolling out the robots this month. New technologies were advertised as helping New York police investigate high-risk areas,\nCBS News reported.\nWhen such technologies were proposed under the former mayor, Bill Blasio, critics warned of unneeded surveillance largely used against\nlow-income people of color. The robot dogs were withdrawn, after backlash to their use in public housing areas and in response to a home\ninvasion in the Bronx.\nAdams has also faced criticism for escalating police powers, including reinstating a notorious plainclothes unit and pledging to\nincrease use of facial recognition technology. Such technology has been criticized as inaccurate and disproportionately used\nagainst minorities.",

    "text": "China shows off mechanical canine with an automatic rifle on its back at joint military drills with Cambodia\nThe Chinese army has debuted its latest weapon: a gun-toting robotic dog.\nThe mechanical canine, which has an automatic rifle on its back, was front and centre of recent joint military drills with Cambodia, according to footage from the state broadcaster CCTV.\nThe dog was backed up by a similarly-armed quadcopter in the drills, which saw the machines paired with human soldiers in dry runs for urban assaults. “It can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our human members to conduct reconnaissance and identify enemy and strike the target,” Chen Wei, a Chinese soldier, said in the video.\nWhile they may be technologically advanced, the killer robots are hardly sleek pieces of military hardware; both dog and drone appear to be off-the-shelf pieces of consumer technology with a conventional rifle bolted on top. The brand name of the Chinese company that built the dog, Unitree Robotics, is clearly visible on the side.\nPrices for the company’s Go2 robot dog start at $1,600 (£1,300), according to Unitree’s website. The company denied selling products to the Chinese military and it is unclear how the army procured it.\nThe robot dog archetype was developed and made famous by Boston Dynamics, at one point a Google subsidiary. It has long had connections with the US military; the initial version of its “robotic quadruped”, BigDog, was developed as a potential mechanical pack animal for the army. But the company, which was sold by Google to Softbank in 2017 and then on to Hyundai in 2020, has always steered clear of actively weaponising its technology.\nAccording to Boston Dynamics’ founder, Marc Raibert, who spoke at the AI Seoul Summit last week, there are “around 1,500” of the company’s “Spot” dogs around the world. “But recently there’s just been a springing out of other robot companies building quite incredible robots,” he said. “It’s very exciting to go from the research lab into commercialisation.”\nThat “springing out” also means that Boston Dynamics’ refusal to weaponise its technology is no longer preventing militaries and law enforcement from obtaining their own armed robots. In 2021, Ghost Robotics demonstrated a Vision 60 robot dog armed with a custom gun built by Sword International, and by 2023 the US Army confirmed that it was actively exploring how to use such a system in the field. In 2022, China demonstrated another weapon-wearing robot being carried and deposited in a training centre by a drone.\nBut while the systems are robotic, they are not yet typically autonomous. The CCTV video shows the Go2 dog being controlled by a soldier with a handheld device. The concern for many observers is what happens if and when that human link is diminished, with AI systems that are able to act quicker and with lower latency than a human operator could.",

    "text": "近日，记者参加了两年一届的2025年德国慕尼黑自动化展，深刻感受到自动化技术在人工智能（AI）加持下更加智能，驱动工业生产与管理不断变革。AI与机器人技术的融合发展在诸多领域全面提速，展现未来工作生活新方式。多家公司推出了新一代人形机器人，不过从现场表现来看，人形机器人在技术和实际应用等方面都还有很多工作要做。\n自动化是现代生产的支柱，也是创新的引擎。众多参展商的展示表明，机器正越来越多地承担起几年前被认为过于复杂的任务。例如，谷歌旗下的Intrinsic公司将AI引入计算机数控机床市场。相关厂商推出的机床管理解决方案，可用基于AI的感知技术检测原料，并利用自动化运动和抓取规划功能，实现零件拾取和放置流程的自动化。机器操作员通过简单的界面管理流程、切换作业和导入零件，无需定制夹具和机器人编程。\n\n机器视觉被广泛用于工业质量控制和流程控制，展会中有130多家参展商来自机器视觉和图像处理领域。主办方组织了40多场关于机器人视觉、AI视觉以及视觉组件和解决方案的演示。对于视觉提供商来说，能提供2D、3D、线扫描和区域扫描相机技术及其合适的组件变得越来越重要。3D视觉感知传感器正成为新一代智能硬件实现空间感知和泛化操作的关键支撑。\n\nAI和数字化不断拓展传统自动化的边界。例如，自动化解决方案帮助节约资源和减少排放。灵活控制流程和实时优化能耗的智能系统也不再是遥远的前景。在新的健康技术领域，诸如实验室自动化、医疗技术支持和医疗保健物流流程的优化表明，围绕这一主题的多样性和社会相关性已经出现。\n尽管基于AI的机器人技术还不能大规模使用，但AI已让机器人的使用变得更加简单灵活。很多厂商已把生成式AI集成到机器人编程中，例如通过直观的语音控制，使自动化解决方案更容易获得。从协作机器人开始，市场上有越来越多的机器人可在没有专业知识的情况下使用。\n\n智能自动化解决方案供应商库卡希望从根本上重新定义机器人的控制方式，并推出了可扩展、可灵活调整的机器人操作系统iiQKA.OS2。这个软件和控制器平台将人工智能与视觉系统结合，使机器人变得更加灵活，而无需进行复杂的编程。库卡还与微软合作，开发了一个AI聊天机器人，可将自然语言命令转化为程序代码。此外，库卡希望通过新的云平台为中小型企业的数字化生产铺平相对经济的道路。\n\n日本机器人制造商安川电机则展示了“动态安全区”的概念。机器人完全不需要防护围栏即可运行，并能保证安全性和高生产率。只有在人们真正接近工作区域时，相关软件才会动态调整机器人的运动，降低速度或停止运行。\n展会上，德国初创企业NEURA Robotics高调发布了其人形机器人4NE1 Gen 3。据介绍，这款机器人身高近1.8米，可举起高达100公斤的重物，拥有先进的AI技术和360度全方位感知能力，无需安全笼即可与人类安全协作。这款专为家庭、工作场所和服务环境设计的机器人计划于今年晚些时候上市。NEURA雄心勃勃的目标是到2030年交付500万台机器人。\n\n与此同时，在沃达丰、SAP和英伟达的支持下，NEURA推出了一个开放的软件平台。它不仅用于连接机器人，还能通过应用商店的方式，开发、分发和部署机器人应用程序。在这个开放式机器人生态系统中，机器人可分享它们从实际用例中学习到的经验。开发者的设想是一个机器人能做什么，其他机器人可跟着学。相关参与者可贡献并销售自己的模块和应用程序。\n\n人形机器人可为制造业自动化提供新的动力。随着技术进步，这些机器人对制造企业的吸引力将会越来越大。德国汽车制造商已在积极研究这个问题。宝马在其位于美国加州的斯巴达堡工厂测试美国人形机器人公司Figure的技术。梅赛德斯—奔驰也在其位于柏林的数字化生产创新中心使用美国供应商Apptronik的阿波罗人形机器人。不过，截至目前，实际应用中与人形机器人这种相对较新的技术相关的挑战还很多。\n展会上，埃斯顿、库卡和新松等中国机器人制造商大规模展示了自己的产品和技术。埃斯顿公司的参展人员告诉科技日报记者，在德国埃尔福特的宁德时代工厂，埃斯顿的机器人已投入电池组装。通过垂直整合供应链，以及高度自动化运营，埃斯顿能以非常经济的方式提供机器人。\n\n自2014年以来，中国一直是全球最大的机器人市场。近年来，全球销售的机器人有一半都在中国安装。在人形机器人供应链中，超过一半的上市公司来自中国。德国的初创公司也从中国采购内置力传感器的机械臂和关节等部件。这表明，中国已成为机器人和AI领域的重量级全球玩家，有望在塑造智能机器人的未来方面发挥重要作用。\n\n不过，德国媒体认为，中国机器人制造商进入德国和欧洲市场仍任重道远。中国制造商还需要学习和了解当地的标准，并打消用户对本地服务可靠性的怀疑。此外，在德国和欧洲，人工智能受到了严格监管。对于人形机器人来说，也还有很多问题没有解决，人们对数据安全问题还有很多保留。",
    "translation": "Recently, the reporter attended the biennial 2025 Munich Automation Show in Germany, and deeply felt that automation technology has become more intelligent with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), driving the continuous transformation of industrial production and management. The integrated development of AI and robotics technology has accelerated in many fields, showing a new way of working and living in the future. Many companies have launched a new generation of humanoid robots, but judging from the on-site performance, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of technology and practical application of humanoid robots.\nAutomation is the backbone of modern production and the engine of innovation. The displays of many exhibitors show that machines are increasingly taking on tasks that were considered too complex a few years ago. For example, Intrinsic, a subsidiary of Google, introduced AI into the computer numerical control machine tool market. The machine tool management solutions launched by relevant manufacturers can detect raw materials with AI-based perception technology, and use automated motion and grasping planning functions to automate the part picking and placement process. Machine operators manage processes, switch jobs and import parts through a simple interface without the need for custom fixtures and robot programming.\nMachine vision is widely used in industrial quality control and process control. There are more than 130 exhibitors from the field of machine vision and image processing at the exhibition. The organizer organized more than 40 demonstrations on robot vision, AI vision, and vision components and solutions. For vision providers, it is becoming increasingly important to provide 2D, 3D, line scan and area scan camera technologies and their suitable components. 3D visual perception sensors are becoming the key support for the new generation of intelligent hardware to achieve spatial perception and generalized operation.\nAI and digitalization are constantly pushing the boundaries of traditional automation. For example, automated solutions help save resources and reduce emissions. Intelligent systems that flexibly control processes and optimize energy consumption in real time are no longer a distant prospect. In the new field of health technology, such as laboratory automation, medical technology support and the optimization of healthcare logistics processes show that diversity and social relevance around this topic have already emerged.\nAlthough AI-based robotics is not yet available on a large scale, AI has made the use of robots simpler and more flexible. Many manufacturers have integrated generative AI into robot programming, such as through intuitive voice control, making automation solutions more accessible. Starting with collaborative robots, there are more and more robots on the market that can be used without professional knowledge.\nKuka, a supplier of intelligent automation solutions, hopes to fundamentally redefine the way robots are controlled and has launched the scalable and flexibly adjustable robot operating system iiQKA.OS2. This software and controller platform combines artificial intelligence with a visual system to make robots more flexible without the need for complex programming. Kuka has also worked with Microsoft to develop an AI chatbot that converts natural language commands into program code. In addition, Kuka hopes to pave a relatively economical path for digital production for small and medium-sized enterprises through a new cloud platform.\nJapanese robot manufacturer Yaskawa Electric demonstrated the concept of \"dynamic safety zone\". The robot can operate without protective fences and ensure safety and high productivity. Only when people really approach the working area will the relevant software dynamically adjust the robot's movement, reduce speed or stop operation.\nAt the exhibition, German startup NEURA Robotics launched its humanoid robot 4NE1 Gen 3. According to reports, the robot is nearly 1.8 meters tall, can lift up to 100 kilograms, has advanced AI technology and 360-degree all-round perception, and can safely collaborate with humans without a safety cage. This robot, designed for home, workplace, and service environments, is scheduled to be available later this year. NEURA's ambitious goal is to deliver 5 million robots by 2030.\nAt the same time, with the support of Vodafone, SAP and NVIDIA, NEURA launched an open software platform. It is not only used to connect robots, but also to develop, distribute and deploy robot applications through the application store. In this open robot ecosystem, robots can share their experience learned from actual use cases. Developers imagine what a robot can do, and other robots can follow suit. Relevant participants can contribute and sell their own modules and applications.\nHumanoid robots can provide new impetus for automation in the manufacturing industry. As technology advances, these robots will become more and more attractive to manufacturers. German automakers are already actively researching this issue. BMW is testing technology from the American humanoid robot company Figure at its Spartanburg plant in California, USA. Mercedes-Benz is also using the Apollo humanoid robot from the American supplier Apptronik at its Digital Production Innovation Center in Berlin. However, as of now, there are still many challenges associated with the relatively new technology of humanoid robots in practical applications.\nAt the exhibition, Chinese robot manufacturers such as Estun, Kuka and Siasun displayed their products and technologies on a large scale. An exhibitor from Estun told Science and Technology Daily that Estun's robots have been put into battery assembly at the CATL factory in Erfurt, Germany. Through vertically integrated supply chains and highly automated operations, Estun can provide robots in a very economical way.\nChina has been the world's largest robot market since 2014. In recent years, half of the robots sold worldwide have been installed in China. In the humanoid robot supply chain, more than half of the listed companies are from China.

This shows that China has become a heavyweight global player in the field of robotics and AI and is expected to play an important role in shaping the future of intelligent robots.\nHowever, German media believes that Chinese robot manufacturers still have a long way to go to enter the German and European markets.
