    "text": "Civil liberties group urges Washington to cancel programme to prevent ‘slide into anti-immigrant dystopia’\nThe US is testing robotic patrol dogs along its frontier with Mexico that it says could provide “mechanical reinforcements”\nfor border guards, in a move criticised by a leading domestic rights group as a “civil liberties disaster”.\nAdding to the outcry, the company that developed the dogs, Ghost Robotics, has previously showcased a four-legged robot that\nhas a sniper rifle attached to its back.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said this week that its research and development arm had offered border guards\n“a helping hand (or ‘paw’)” to work to “force-multiply” patrols.\n“Due to the demands of the region, adding quadruped mechanical reinforcements is a smart use of resources,” the DHS said in a blog post.\nGavin Kenneally, the chief operating officer at Ghost Robotics, said the unarmed 45kg robot dog was “bred” to walk on sand,\nrocks and hills, as well as human-built environments such as stairs.\nThe robots were tested in El Paso, Texas, on the international border. “In a desert area, the dogs were programmed to go on\nsimulated sentry duty,” DHS said.\nIt suggested that the bulky metal robots could even be used “as cover” for border guards.\n“Just like anywhere else, you have your standard criminal behaviour, but along the border you can also have human smuggling,\ndrug smuggling, as well as smuggling of other contraband – including firearms or even potentially, [weapons of mass destruction],”\nagent Brett Becker, of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) innovation team, was quoted as saying.\nFederal agents operating along the Mexican border have long been accused of misconduct and mistreatment of the migrants and\nasylum seekers attempting to enter the US. Joe Biden’s administration has been sharply criticised by refugee advocates for the\ngrowing number of immigrants being held at private facilities.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union warned on Thursday that Washington’s plan to use robot patrol dogs on its borders was “a civil\nliberties disaster in the making”.\n“The government must retract this dangerous proposal, and the Biden administration must put the brakes on our country’s slide\ninto an anti-immigrant dystopia,” the advocacy group said.\nIn its post, DHS said people should not be “surprised if in the future we see robot ‘Fido’ out in the field, walking\nside-by-side with [CBP] personnel”.",

    "text": "China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as key to upgrading military strength, solving problems created by a\nshrinking workforce, and a source of national pride\nOn a misty Saturday afternoon in Shenzhen’s Central Park, a gaggle of teenage girls are sheltering from the drizzle under\na concrete canopy. With their bags of crisps piled high in front of them, they crowd around a couple of smartphones\nto sing along to Mandopop ballads. The sound of their laughter rings out across the surrounding lawn – until it is\npierced by a mechanical buzzing sound. Someone has ordered dinner.\nA few metres away from the impromptu karaoke session is an “airdrop cabinet”, one of more than 40 in Shenzhen that is\noperated by Meituan, China’s biggest food delivery platform. Hungry park-goers can order anything from rice noodles to\nSubway sandwiches to bubble tea.\nA drone, loaded up with goods from a shopping mall less than three kilometres away, flies into view, and earshot,\nhovering over the delivery station for a moment, before steadily lowering and depositing the goods into a sealed box\nthat can only be unlocked by entering the customer’s phone number. Dinner is served with not a human in sight.\nMeituan aims to beat human delivery times by about 10%, although perhaps because of its journey whizzing through\nthe clouds in a thin polystyrene box, the food, char siu pork and a waffle, is slightly cold.\nThe drones are a small part of the broader robotics and artificial intelligence industry that China is intent on\nexpanding on this year.\nWith a trade war raging, demographic challenges dragging on the economy and the prospect of a productive relationship\nwith the world’s largest economy looking ever more remote, Beijing is doubling down on the industries where it sees the\npotential – and the need – to develop ahead of the US. China’s leaders see artificial intelligence as being the key to\nupgrading its military strength, solving the problems created by a shrinking workforce, and a source of national pride –\nespecially when Chinese firms manage to circumvent US-led sanctions on core technology. And technology firms, for many\nyears shunned by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as he sought to crack down on excessive wealth and influence outside the Chinese\nCommunist party’s control, are being welcomed back into the fold as Xi seeks to restore confidence in the private sector and\nencourage domestic innovation.\nIn March, Premier Li Qiang promised to “unleash the creativity of the digital economy”, with a particular focus on\n“embodied AI”. Guangdong, which includes the tech hub of Shenzhen, is at the forefront of this movement. The\nprovincial government recently announced 60m yuan (£6.4m) in new funding for innovation centres. Shenzhen in\nparticular is known as China’s drone capital, because of the authorities’ progressive approach to drone regulations,\nallowing the “low altitude economy” to develop faster than in other parts of the country. China’s Civil Aviation\nAdministration predicts that the value of the sector will increase five-fold to 3.5tn yuan in the next decade.\nIt is not just drones that are promising – or threatening – to upend the tempo of urban life in China. Humanoid\nrobots are particularly buzzy. The highlight of this year’s Spring festival gala, which was viewed nearly 17bn\ntimes, was a dance performed by a troupe of humanoid robots made by a company called Unitree. On Saturday, the\nworld’s first humanoid v human race – a half marathon – took place on the outskirts of Beijing.\n“Applying artificial intelligence to robots basically really kicked into high gear last year,” says Rui Ma, a\nChina technology analyst and investor based in San Francisco. The shift could allow the industry to grow at a\nmuch faster rate in 2025 than in previous years. Reinforcement learning, which means training robots to learn from\nexperience rather than relying on rigid models, allows humanoid robots to be trained in months rather than years,\nhastening the pace of innovation. Toy robot dogs are already part of daily life in China. At a wholesale market in\nYiwu, a trading hub in east China’s Zhejiang province, a child plays with a robot dog while his mother haggles with\nexporters over the price of false eyelashes. On the streets of Shanghai, a woman walks her robot dog, which is helpfully\ncarrying a basket of shopping on its back.\nThe development of China’s robotics industry is intimately linked to advances in AI. For years, China has been\ntrying to catch up with the United States. Xi wants to drive economic growth through “new quality productive forces”,\na concept that includes advanced technologies.\nMany in Washington fear that the US’s lead is narrowing. One major tool in the US’s arsenal has been its control over\nthe important parts of the supply chain for semiconductors, the microchips used to train advanced AI models. The US\nrestricts the export of the most sophisticated chips to China, part of a strategy described by former national security\nadviser Jake Sullivan as “high fence” around the US’s most strategically valuable technology.\nBut in January, a previously unknown Chinese firm called DeepSeek set the Chinese tech scene alight with the release of\na large language reasoning model, R1, which performs as well as leading US competitors, at a fraction of the price. The\nmodel sparked a stock market crash, with $1tn wiped off Wall Street’s leading tech index as investors feared that the US’s\npole position in the tech race was no longer guaranteed.\n“You can’t really overemphasise how crazy of a moment that was,” says Ma.\nSince then, China’s AI industry has been brimming with optimism. It was already being promoted by the government as the\nanswer to China’s long term, sustainable growth, and now, says Ma, the public has started to believe it too.\nLi Shuhao, a tech entrepreneur based in Guangzhou who founded an AI marketing company, Tec-Do, in 2017, was in the United\nStates when the DeepSeek moment happened. All of a sudden, “it was way easier for me to arrange interviews and arrange meetings\nwith other AI scientists,” he says.\n“DeepSeek is kind of a symbol for the Oriental way of doing business,” says Li, a self-confessed “metalhead”, surrounded by electric\nguitars and a drum kit in his office in Guangzhou. He is referring to the strategy pursued by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s founder,\nof financing it through his own hedge fund rather than seeking external venture capital funding. “This is how typical Chinese\nentrepreneurs think. Just survive first, then do something new.”\nDeepSeek published its work as open source, a principle that the government has long favoured and a move which has encouraged\nwidespread adoption of its model. Robotics has been a particular beneficiary.\nPutting tech first\nThe robotics supply chain can loosely be divided into three areas: the brain, the body, and the application of the technology\nin the real world. China has long been confident in its ability in the latter two areas – advanced supply chains in other hi-tech\nindustries such as electric vehicles and autonomous drones show that China has both the capacity to produce industrial components\nat scale and the knowhow to assemble them into complex goods. But solving the trickiest part of the puzzle, making a robot brain\nthat can learn human-like behaviours and movements, has been elusive. It requires sophisticated AI.\nDeepSeek’s R1 model changed the game, paving a way for domestic humanoid robotics companies to catch up with overseas competitors,\nsaid analysts at Goldman Sachs in a recent note. The fact that DeepSeek’s open-source model uses less advanced chips helps level the\nplaying field for Chinese companies.\nThe industry is still fraught with challenges. Any AI model requires reams of data for training. While LLMs used for things like\nchatbots can draw upon the vast universe of content that is the internet, the data for robotic AI models, such as information on\nhow to physically move through space and interact with objects or people, is relatively scarce.\nIn the world of autonomous vehicles, another sector that China is focusing on, a car needs to be able to navigate through six axes,\nor “degrees of freedom”: forwards and backwards, left and right, up and down, and the rotations between these positions. The same\ngoes for general robotics, such as Meituan’s food delivery drones. For a humanoid robot to be able to mimic a human in everyday\ntasks, such as cooking, it needs up to 60 degrees of freedom. Unitree’s H1 model that caused a splash at the Spring Gala has 27.\nRobots don’t need to be fully humanoid to be useful. Robots on wheels or humanoids with limited motion can still take on tasks\nthat are ripe for automation, such as dangerous or repetitive factory jobs. UBTech, a Shenzhen-based company, already supplies\nhumanoid robots to car factories. With a shrinking workforce, China is keen to find ways to automate wherever possible.\nAt last month’s Boao Forum for Asia, a business conference, organisers were keen to dish out jianbing, a savoury pancake that\nis a typical Chinese street food, made by a robotic arm in a booth, similar to the claws that collect stuffed toys in an arcade\n(the resulting snack was not as crispy as a human-made offering). Parks in Beijing have ramped up their surveillance abilities by\nsticking cameras on autonomous buggies which drive along the paths.\n“Robots are not replacing the vast majority of the labour force,” says Amber Zhang, a product manager at BigOne Lab, a Beijing-based\ndata intelligence firm. “For instance, if you look at robot taxis, how many cab drivers are actually getting replaced? There are still\na lot of hurdles”.\nIn a handful of cities across China, the tech company Baidu operates fleets of autonomous taxis, called Apollo Go, or\nrobotaxis. But a recent attempt by the Guardian to hail a ride in Shenzhen was foiled twice: the robotaxis only operate\nin one district of the city, and when the Guardian tried to order one there, the wait was nearly 20 minutes before the app\napologised and said that none could be found. A human-driven taxi turned up within four minutes. Robocops, touted by state\nmedia as a way of beefing up Shenzhen’s security apparatus, are nowhere to be seen.\nBut it’s undeniable that the narrative has shifted. With other sectors of China’s economy facing significant challenges – exports\nare under pressure from tariffs; consumer demand remains weak – the government is keen to back a winning horse. “Now that real estate\nis no longer a source of revenue for many local governments, they have to attract good companies and support what they are doing,” Zhang says.\nThe story of technology underpinning growth “is clicking for people,” says Ma, “and it’s also partly because, where else can then invest?”\nThat is a marked shift from just a few years ago, when tech bosses were pushed to the sidelines as Xi cracked down on excessive wealth\nand influence in the private sector. The sudden cancellation in 2020 of an IPO by Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, sent a chill\nthrough the technology and finance sectors, as did the fall from grace of Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma.\nBut Ma was recently invited to a rare in-person meeting with Xi, along with other tech bosses including DeepSeek’s Liang, as Xi\ntried show that tech entrepreneurs are back in fashion.\nSuch meetings “give us confidence” says Li. “Maybe the bad time has ended”.",

    "text": "Robots praised by New York mayor for searching ruins of a parking garage collapse, but critics fear robots will collect private data\n“Digidog is out of the pound,” Eric Adams declared in April. The New York City mayor also insisted the successful use of the\ncontroversial robot in response to a recent building collapse should convince critics such devices can improve safety in the city.\nAdams commended first responders’ use of the four-legged robot in the ruins of a parking garage collapse last week in Manhattan,\nin which one person was killed and five injured.\nFirst responders used the robot to search the rubble while safety concerns about the building’s structure persisted.\n“Some people call them toys,” Adams told reporters. “This is not playtime. This is real time. And this is an administration that\nis not going to be fearful of using everything possible to save the lives of New Yorkers and to save the lives of first responders.”\nCritics said the use of such robots in the building collapse response did not negate legitimate concerns about the use of robots\nfor surveillance and aggressive policing.\nDonna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the New York Times: “While deploying a robot is,\nof course, appropriate in situations like this, that doesn’t eliminate the need for transparency about this and other technologies\nthat may have the capacity to engage in massive surveillance and routinely collect massive amounts of private personal data on\nmillions of New Yorkers.”\nCritics also noted that it was not clear how useful the Digidog was in the building collapse response.\n“I want to believe that these robots would be effective in a building collapse,” Albert Fox Cahn, an attorney and executive\ndirector of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told the Times. “But we need more than a couple of soundbites.”\nAdams began rolling out the robots this month. New technologies were advertised as helping New York police investigate high-risk areas,\nCBS News reported.\nWhen such technologies were proposed under the former mayor, Bill Blasio, critics warned of unneeded surveillance largely used against\nlow-income people of color. The robot dogs were withdrawn, after backlash to their use in public housing areas and in response to a home\ninvasion in the Bronx.\nAdams has also faced criticism for escalating police powers, including reinstating a notorious plainclothes unit and pledging to\nincrease use of facial recognition technology. Such technology has been criticized as inaccurate and disproportionately used\nagainst minorities.",

    "text": "China shows off mechanical canine with an automatic rifle on its back at joint military drills with Cambodia\nThe Chinese army has debuted its latest weapon: a gun-toting robotic dog.\nThe mechanical canine, which has an automatic rifle on its back, was front and centre of recent joint military drills with Cambodia, according to footage from the state broadcaster CCTV.\nThe dog was backed up by a similarly-armed quadcopter in the drills, which saw the machines paired with human soldiers in dry runs for urban assaults. “It can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our human members to conduct reconnaissance and identify enemy and strike the target,” Chen Wei, a Chinese soldier, said in the video.\nWhile they may be technologically advanced, the killer robots are hardly sleek pieces of military hardware; both dog and drone appear to be off-the-shelf pieces of consumer technology with a conventional rifle bolted on top. The brand name of the Chinese company that built the dog, Unitree Robotics, is clearly visible on the side.\nPrices for the company’s Go2 robot dog start at $1,600 (£1,300), according to Unitree’s website. The company denied selling products to the Chinese military and it is unclear how the army procured it.\nThe robot dog archetype was developed and made famous by Boston Dynamics, at one point a Google subsidiary. It has long had connections with the US military; the initial version of its “robotic quadruped”, BigDog, was developed as a potential mechanical pack animal for the army. But the company, which was sold by Google to Softbank in 2017 and then on to Hyundai in 2020, has always steered clear of actively weaponising its technology.\nAccording to Boston Dynamics’ founder, Marc Raibert, who spoke at the AI Seoul Summit last week, there are “around 1,500” of the company’s “Spot” dogs around the world. “But recently there’s just been a springing out of other robot companies building quite incredible robots,” he said. “It’s very exciting to go from the research lab into commercialisation.”\nThat “springing out” also means that Boston Dynamics’ refusal to weaponise its technology is no longer preventing militaries and law enforcement from obtaining their own armed robots. In 2021, Ghost Robotics demonstrated a Vision 60 robot dog armed with a custom gun built by Sword International, and by 2023 the US Army confirmed that it was actively exploring how to use such a system in the field. In 2022, China demonstrated another weapon-wearing robot being carried and deposited in a training centre by a drone.\nBut while the systems are robotic, they are not yet typically autonomous. The CCTV video shows the Go2 dog being controlled by a soldier with a handheld device. The concern for many observers is what happens if and when that human link is diminished, with AI systems that are able to act quicker and with lower latency than a human operator could.",

    "translation": "On July 8, Hangzhou Yunshenchu ​​Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yunshenchu ​​Technology) announced the completion of a new round of financing of nearly RMB 500 million. This round of financing was jointly led by Dachen Capital and Guoxin Fund, followed by Beijing Robot Industry Development Investment Fund, Qianhai Mother Fund, CCTV Media Integration Fund, Fuzhe Fund, Huaying Capital, Wuchan Zhongda Investment and other institutions, and old shareholders such as Junshan Capital, Fanguang Capital and Aisidi Zhicheng Fund continued to support.\n\nYunshenchu ​​Technology was founded in 2017. In 2018, it launched a quadruped robot that can go up and down stairs, autonomously navigate, and intelligently interact. In 2019, it released a quadruped robot with autonomous charging capabilities. The company is committed to expanding the boundaries of embodied intelligent robot technology and applications. With continuous breakthroughs in technology research and development and scene implementation, it has rapidly grown into one of the \"Six Little Dragons of Hangzhou\" that has attracted much attention in the industry, and has become a new force in the globalization of \"Chinese Intelligent Manufacturing\".\nSince its establishment, Yunshenchu ​​Technology has been focusing on independent research and development, lean production, global sales and professional services of humanoid robots, quadruped robots and their core components, and has achieved the implementation of 600+ industry scenarios, and has been widely used in B-side application fields such as power inspection and emergency rescue. At present, the company has more than 100 authorized patents, including more than 20 authorized invention patents.\n\nIn April this year, Yunshenchu ​​Technology released the Bobcat M20, a wheeled-legged robot designed for industrial applications in complex terrain and dangerous environments. It combines the speed of a wheeled robot with the flexibility of a legged robot, weighs 33kg, and can be carried by one person. It has an IP66 protection level, can operate normally in a temperature range of -20℃ to 55℃, can climb 80cm high platforms, and supports autonomous perception, autonomous navigation, and omnidirectional obstacle avoidance.\n\nWith its advanced AI motion control algorithm, the Bobcat M20 can autonomously adjust its movement posture and calmly cope with extreme operating environments such as bumpy mountain roads, muddy wetlands, and ruins obstacles, achieving full-domain operations and breaking through application boundaries.

    "translation": "On April 19, the world's first humanoid robot half marathon was held in Beijing. On the 21.0975-kilometer track, 20 robot teams from universities, research institutes, and enterprises participated in the first \"human-robot co-run\".\n\nIn the previous Spring Festival Gala of the Year of the Snake, more than 10 Yushu robots dressed in flowery cotton jackets took to the stage, dancing the Yangko dance and spinning handkerchiefs with real dancers, which attracted great attention from all parties. People exclaimed that humanoid robots have entered the lives of ordinary people.\nBuilding a human-like machine is a long-standing dream of mankind. From the record of Yanshi making a \"doll\" in the ancient book \"Liezi·Tangwen\" to the birth of the world's first humanoid robot WABOT-1 at Waseda University in Japan in 1973, people have never stopped exploring humanoid robots. Over the past half century, the development of this industry has been ups and downs, and countries around the world have launched a variety of humanoid robots, but the overall development has been slow.\n\nWhy is the development of humanoid robots suddenly accelerating today?\n\"You can meet a humanoid robot every few steps.\" At the end of March, a guest attending the Zhongguancun Forum Annual Meeting said. During the annual meeting, nearly 100 humanoid robots from more than 10 companies were active in scenes such as welcoming guests, communicating, hosting, and performing.\nIn the more than two months since the Spring Festival, popular videos of humanoid robots have often appeared on social media, demonstrating stunts such as front flips, back flips, and bicycle riding, refreshing people's understanding of embodied intelligence.\n\nEmbodied intelligence is a new term that has entered the public eye in recent years. It emphasizes the close integration of intelligent systems and the body, and the realization of intelligent behavior through the interaction between the body and the environment. The concept that is different from it is disembodied intelligence, such as chatbots that have no physical body and rely entirely on computing and data processing to achieve intelligent behavior.\n\nHumanoid robots are one of the typical application forms of embodied intelligence. At this year's National People's Congress, the government work report clearly stated that it would establish a mechanism for increasing investment in future industries and cultivate future industries including embodied intelligence.\nSome factories, universities, research institutes, artificial intelligence companies, etc. are taking the lead in using humanoid robots.\n\nIn a video recently released by UBTECH, two 1.72-meter-tall Walker S1 robots stood face to face at the Zeekr Automotive Factory. They nodded to each other at the same time, then opened their arms and worked together to carry a material box that was 1.2 meters long, 50 centimeters wide and 40 centimeters high.\n\n\"The work efficiency of robots is about 70% of that of skilled workers.\" Leng Xiaokun, founder of Leju Company, said that the robot \"Kuafu\" that has entered the car factory for training cannot do complex work undertaken by senior technicians such as driving precision screws, but can only do heavy, generalized and highly repetitive work, such as carrying boxes of different sizes, colors, weights and dimensions, and sorting spare parts of different shapes.\n\nYushu Technology, which has no plans to bring robots into factories, has recently launched new products on domestic and overseas e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and AliExpress. Yushu has two types of products: four-legged robot dogs are mainly for C-end consumers, and humanoid robots are mainly for developers.\n\nHuang Jiawei, marketing director of Yushu, said that last year, Yushu humanoid robots were sold to more than 100 countries and regions, and the core users were universities, research institutes, technology AI companies, etc. Users do secondary development on Yushu hardware.\n\nThe industrial layout of humanoid robots is accelerating in many places across the country. At present, more than 10 local governments including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Chongqing have established or are preparing to establish industrial funds.\n\nIn the investment community, the popularity of robotics companies is also increasing. According to data from IT Juzi, a data service provider for venture capital and emerging technology industries, in the first three months of this year, more than 50 companies in the embodied intelligence track received more than 6 billion yuan in financing.\nIn 1973, Waseda University launched the world's first full-size humanoid robot WABOT-1, which takes 45 seconds to walk each step. At the beginning of this century, Honda of Japan released the humanoid robot ASIMO, which can go up and down stairs. In 2013, Boston Dynamics of the United States released the humanoid robot Atlas, which has amazing athletic ability...\n\nDespite several technological iterations, the humanoid robot industry was dormant until it began to accelerate in recent years. Why?\nWang Tianmiao, honorary director of the Robotics Institute of Beihang University, said that robot development has long been based on programming. In 2022, a large AI model will be released that can simulate the human brain and have capabilities such as generalization and migration, which will promote the development of a new species of humanoid robots.\n\nXiong Rong, director of the Zhejiang Humanoid Robot Innovation Center and professor at Zhejiang University, said that the traditional robotics research paradigm relies on mathematical modeling of human movement texture. Today, people can use large-scale data collection and neural network training to enable robots to master more implicit knowledge and draw inferences from one example.\n\nIt is also a consensus in the industry that artificial intelligence empowers robots.\n\nIn the view of Zhang Jin, president of Shenyang Siasun Robot & Automation Co., Ltd., the biggest force driving the development of humanoid robots is the new generation of artificial intelligence, which gives humanoid robots a \"brain\" and gradually acquires generalization capabilities.\n\nMany experts interviewed mentioned a landmark event in the industry in 2022: Tesla officially released the humanoid robot Optimus. Musk showed a video of it moving boxes and grabbing metal bars in a car factory, and said it would be mass-produced.\nZhao Mingguo, director of the Robotics and Control Laboratory at Tsinghua University, observed that Tesla introduced the supply chain advantages of the automotive industry into the field of robotics, significantly reducing hardware costs.\n\nHumanoid robots are mainly controlled by the \"brain\", \"cerebellum\" and \"body\". Take the example of letting a humanoid robot get a glass of water - to decompose instructions, identify the environment, and plan the path, the \"brain\" needs to have multi-level decision-making capabilities; to complete specific actions such as walking, taking, pouring, and handing over, the \"cerebellum\" needs precise control.\n\nSome products unveiled this year have demonstrated the improvement of key robotics technologies. The Yushu robot that performed at the Spring Festival Gala was considered to have a \"well-developed cerebellum\" and demonstrated a high level of motion control. The \"Huisi Kaiwu\" platform released by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center attempts to build a general software system that is compatible with multiple entities and multiple scenarios and has strong generalization capabilities.\n\nThe industry believes that the biggest bottleneck restricting the development of humanoid robots is still the \"brain\".\n\nZhang Weinan, deputy director of the School of Computer Science and executive dean of the School of Artificial Intelligence at Harbin Institute of Technology, said that in terms of \"brain\", there are no breakthrough products like large models at home and abroad. In terms of software, high-quality, large-scale data for cross-scenario use is relatively lacking. In terms of hardware, dedicated computing chips for machine brains need further research and development and popularization.\n\nXu Huazhe, co-founder of Xinghaitu AI and assistant professor at the School of Interdisciplinary Information Sciences at Tsinghua University, focuses on the basic large-scale model of embodied intelligence. He used cooking as an example to describe the level that an ideal robot \"brain\" can achieve.\n\n\"I want the robot to cook a squirrel mandarin fish because it is difficult to operate - the fish is alive, slippery and sticky, and has granular scales. Not only do you have to deal with live fish, but you also have to know how to cut, fry, stir-fry sugar color, pour sauce, and arrange the dish.\" Xu Huazhe said that it will take at least a dozen years before people can eat this dish made by a robot.\n\nRecently, videos of humanoid robots serving tea and threading needles on grapes have been widely circulated on social media, leading many people to believe that they will soon be able to buy a robot to serve as a babysitter. However, many industry experts are cautious about this.\n\nZhang Rui, founder of Beijing Iron Man Technology Co., Ltd., and his team were selected to participate in the Chinese Astronaut Humanoid Robot Project in 2021. He admitted that compared to going into space, it is more difficult and takes longer for humanoid robots to enter the home. Because the home is a complex environment - there may be elderly people, children, cats and dogs; the flatness and friction of different floors are different, and there is a risk of humanoid robots tipping over when walking. He believes that humanoid robots entering homes in the future cannot be a stack of existing mechanical and electronic structures, but must use new materials to form a new generation of muscles and bones.\n\nIn Leng Xiaokun's view, humanoid robots that will enter households in the future must be as cheap as household appliances and as smart as robots. He said that it is only a matter of time before the cost of robots is reduced, but how to apply AI intelligence to the main body is a difficult point in research.\n\nThe first phase of the factory of Shanghai Zhiyuan Xinchuang Technology Co., Ltd. is located in an industrial park at the junction of Shanghai Lingang and Fengxian Districts. It is known in the industry as the first mass production factory of humanoid robots in Shanghai. In January this year, the 1,000th universal embodied robot rolled off the production line. The factory is divided into two floors, the first floor is for production and assembly, and the second floor is for whole machine testing.\n\n\"Just like a human has more than 200 bones, the bipedal humanoid robot A2 has more than 400 parts.\" Yao Maoqing, partner of Zhiyuan and president of the embodied business department, said that the robot is not finished after being assembled, but just the beginning. In order to avoid unstable walking or falling in the future, it must go through one sub-item test after another, such as squatting with a single leg load of 30 kilograms, which must be tested more than 2,000 times.\nIn addition to humanoid robot start-ups, there are two other types of companies that are involved in the research and development of humanoid robots: one is leading technology companies, such as Huawei, iFlytek, etc., which approach from the perspective of artificial intelligence and provide \"intelligence\" for robots; the other is new energy vehicle companies, such as Xiaopeng and Xiaomi, which are mainly based on the migration of humanoid robots and smart cars in the supply chain of batteries, chips, sensors, etc., and have similarities in the application of autonomous driving technology and AI models.\n\n\"Although humanoid robots first appeared abroad, they are most likely to be truly industrialized in China, because China has a very complete industrial chain, and all the necessary core components and technologies are researched by teams.\" Zhang Jin said that some focus on making the \"brain\", some are good at making feet, arms, etc., and everyone will work together to form a complete and healthy industrial ecology.\n\nHe Xiaopeng, founder of Xpeng Motors, said that the company is currently focusing on developing large models of the physical world required for the \"brain\". The current humanoid robot is close to the initial stage of L2 autonomous driving, and it is hoped that L3 capabilities that can be mass-produced and have commercial value will be achieved as soon as possible.\nThe acceleration of the humanoid robot industry is also due to the development of my country's robotics industry over the past few decades, which has accumulated a large number of technologies and customers in the fields of industry, services, etc. Last year, the sales volume of my country's industrial robot market exceeded 290,000 units, with the highest degree of application in the automotive and electronics industries.\n\nWu Fengli, founder of Guangdong Topstar Technology Co., Ltd., which specializes in industrial robots, said: \"The confidence to make humanoid robots in the future lies in the fact that the company already has more than 200,000 manufacturing customers, and the humanoid robot products developed can be used by existing customers as soon as possible.\"\n\nZhang Jin said that SIASUN has been focusing on industrial robots for more than 20 years and has accumulated rich industrial knowledge and experience. Once a large number of application scenarios of humanoid robots appear in the industrial field, the company's humanoid robot team can quickly follow up.\n\nThe industry believes that the engineer bonus is one of the important advantages of my country in developing humanoid robots. my country has cultivated the world's largest and most complete engineering team. In 2016, the Ministry of Education approved \"Robotics Engineering\" as an undergraduate major. So far, more than 300 universities have opened undergraduate majors in Robotics Engineering.\n\nAt the policy level, both the national and local governments have clearly accelerated deployment. The \"Guiding Opinions on the Innovation and Development of Humanoid Robots\" issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in 2023 proposed that humanoid robots are expected to become disruptive products after computers, smartphones, and new energy vehicles. In the \"Implementation Opinions on Promoting the Innovation and Development of Future Industries\" issued by seven departments last year, humanoid robots ranked first in the \"Innovation Iconic Products\" column. In recent years, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and other places have introduced supporting policies.\n\nThe path to the future of humanoid robots has become increasingly clear. Artificial intelligence + advanced manufacturing are putting China at the forefront of the world's robotics revolution.\nIn which fields will humanoid robots be used first?\n\nThe guiding opinions of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology put forward three scenarios: serving the needs of special fields, creating typical scenarios for the manufacturing industry, and accelerating promotion in people's livelihood and key industries.\n\nExperts say that some operations with harsh conditions and dangerous scenes, such as civil explosions and rescue operations, require humanoid robots to reduce the danger of work. Although manufacturing is an important scene, humanoid robots are currently only responsible for simple tasks and are less efficient than ordinary workers.\n\nThe industry generally believes that if humanoid robots are to be put into more widespread real-world applications, they must first enter \"vocational skills training schools.\"\nThe data collection center of Shanghai Zhiyuan Robotics is such a school. In a space of about 4,000 square meters, hundreds of data collectors wear VR glasses and hold operating handles to teach robots how to do housework - folding clothes, clearing dishes, pouring tea, and cashiering in supermarkets... Each action requires the robot to repeat hundreds of times.\n\nPeng Zhihui, founder of Zhiyuan, explained that unlike the text, pictures, videos and other data required by large language models, robots need to interact with tangible objects in the three-dimensional world. This kind of data cannot be obtained from the Internet and can only be obtained by investing a lot of manpower and material resources to collect massive amounts of real robot interaction data.\n\nAt the same time, the national and local jointly built humanoid robot innovation centers in Beijing and Shanghai have also established humanoid robot \"technical schools\".\n\nLeng Xiaokun believes that these training grounds abstract the scenes of actual production and life, complete tasks through manual operation of robots, collect multi-dimensional data, and then input the data into the embodied intelligent model. After the model is mature, it will be deployed to the robot to enable it to acquire new skills. This is the core work of the development of humanoid robots in the next few years.\n\nMany people are worried that \"their jobs will be taken away by humanoid robots.\" In this regard, a factory manager told reporters that they recruited about 900 people the year before last, more than 450 people last year, and only a little over 300 people this year. There are still many vacancies and there are indeed some jobs that lack people to do.\n\nXiong Rong said that if humanoid robots are used on a large scale, they can replace humans in dangerous, repetitive and boring work, and are expected to solve the problem of labor shortage in future society.\n\nIn the future, humanoid robots will bring great convenience to human work and life, but may also bring challenges to the original social order.\n\nPeople worry that robots may get out of control at any time, that human rights may be violated without their knowledge, and that the actions of robots cannot be traced or held accountable.\nWang Tianran, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and an expert in robotics and industrial automation, believes that the way these problems are solved directly determines the public's acceptance of robots and their technologies. How to constrain the behavior of robots should be a concern for robot designers, manufacturers, users and even social managers.\n\nProfessor Liu Zhe of Peking University believes that although it is still a long way to go for humanoid robots to have the same autonomy as humans, their autonomy will bring multiple ethical dilemmas to human society. Therefore, when conducting ethical governance, not only should there be ethical considerations in the design of robots, but there should also be an ethical framework with social consensus.\n\nThis dance between humans and machines has just begun, and its steps will determine the rhythm of the future of civilization."

    "translation": "In a laboratory in Shanghai Zhangjiang Robot Valley, engineers from Fourier Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. are adjusting the grip strength of the dexterous hands of a general humanoid robot GR-2. The 1.75-meter-tall robot will be sent to a rehabilitation center to undertake rehabilitation training tasks.\n\n50 kilometers away in the Lingang New Area, in the factory of Zhiyuan Robotics, several Yuanzheng A2 robots are undergoing final functional testing on the assembly line. They will soon go to automobile factories and 4S stores to become \"digital workers\" and \"smart salesmen.\"\n\nIn Shanghai, more and more humanoid robots are moving from laboratories to application scenarios. Relying on Shanghai's high-end manufacturing base and the Yangtze River Delta's complete supply chain and industrial supporting facilities, the humanoid robot industry is accelerating its \"evolution\".\nData accumulation is crucial to improving the intelligence of robots.\n\nIn the past few decades, robots’ actions have often relied on people’s preset rules. If you want robots to make decisions and adapt to changes, you need to continuously “feed” data to the big model. The larger the amount of data, the closer the big model’s performance will be to humans in a certain scenario.\n\nWhere does the data come from? From the training of application scenarios.\n\n\"Last September, we launched the industry's first data collection plant. Every day, 100 robots are trained here, generating tens of thousands of data, which provide 'nutrients' for robot learning.\" Hu Jingping, deputy general manager of the public affairs department of Shanghai Zhiyuan New Technology Co., Ltd., introduced that for a simple action of pouring water, data collectors need to let the robot repeat it hundreds of times or even more.\n\nTraining is so important, but if every company builds its own training ground, the cost will be high. What to do? Shanghai said: I will do it.\n\nIn January this year, the country's first heterogeneous humanoid robot training ground was officially opened in Shanghai. The 5,000-square-meter training ground was built by the National and Local Co-construction Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, which was led by central enterprises and jointly built by upstream and downstream enterprises in the industrial chain, universities and scientific research institutions. This is an important means for Shanghai to support and cultivate the humanoid robot industry and form a collaborative innovation network of \"government, industry, academia, research and application\".\n\nThe reporter saw that hundreds of robots from companies such as Zhiyuan, Fourier, Kepler, and Shanghai Electric were being trained here to learn skills such as walking, folding quilts, washing dishes, screwing, and welding. This year, the training ground is expected to accumulate 10 million pieces of data, forming a leading heterogeneous humanoid robot data set in the industry.\n\n\"The reason why it is a 'heterogeneous' training ground is that if artificial intelligence uses homogeneous data, it will produce AI illusions. Therefore, when building it, we joined forces with more than a dozen humanoid robot companies to capture all the movements.\" Jiang Lei, chief scientist of the National and Local Co-built Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, said that the training ground is actually a data production factory, which will generate more data in the future for enterprises to use and help the development of the industry.\n\nIn order to break through technical barriers through open collaboration, in 2024, the National and Local Co-construction Humanoid Robot Innovation Center launched the world's first full-size universal humanoid robot open source public version \"Qinglong\", and at the same time launched the world's first full-size humanoid robot open source community \"OpenLoong\", attracting global developers to share data and further lowering the threshold for research and development. \"This is like the significance of the Android system to the mobile phone industry. Only by lowering the threshold can the ecological prosperity be accelerated.\" said Xu Bin, general manager of the National and Local Co-construction Humanoid Robot Innovation Center.\n\n“Use patient capital to support original innovation”\n\nSince last year, central documents have repeatedly mentioned the need to develop \"patient capital\", which mainly refers to capital that does not pursue short-term returns as its primary goal, focuses on long-term projects or investment activities, and has a higher risk tolerance.\n\nAs a future industry, the development of humanoid robots requires the support of patient capital.\n\n\"Every innovation costs money,\" said Wang Bing, general manager of Shanghai Humanoid Robot Innovation Incubator. \"China's local innovation is not accidental, but the result of long-term accumulation. We need to use patient capital and long-term capital to support original innovation and disruptive innovation.\"\n\nTo this end, Shanghai has set up a humanoid robot industry fund of tens of billions of yuan to attract social capital. At the same time, the districts, counties and blocks under its jurisdiction have also established industry guidance funds accordingly. In 2024, the humanoid robot sub-fund prepared by Pudong New Area will focus on key areas such as embodied intelligence and large models. Baoshan District has launched the Shanghai Shoubao Zhiye Investment Fund, with a scale of about 500 million yuan. This year, with the support of the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, the Humanoid Robot Innovation Center is initiating the establishment of a 200 million yuan fund for the vertical field of humanoid robots.\n\nWith the support of patient capital, the humanoid robot industry ecosystem in Shanghai is becoming increasingly prosperous.\n\nThe research and development of star enterprises is accelerating. Fourier has completed nearly 800 million yuan in E-round financing and will work with Shanghai International Medical Center to build the first embodied intelligent rehabilitation demonstration base in China. Its product GR-1 has been commercialized, with more than 100 units delivered in total, and new generation products GR-2 and Fourier N1 have been launched one after another. Zhiyuan received a B-round financing led by Tencent, and its valuation soared to 15 billion yuan. In January this year, Zhiyuan's 1,000th mass-produced universal embodied robot officially rolled off the assembly line; in March, Lingxi X2, a bipedal humanoid robot that can ride a bicycle, was officially released. In terms of core components, companies such as Buke Co., Ltd., Mingzhi Electric, and Hesai Technology have also emerged.\n\nStanding on the observation deck of Zhangjiang Robot Valley, you can see Fourier's laboratory, Zhiyuan's factory, and the training ground of the National Land Center arranged in sequence, just like the \"Silicon Valley\" of the humanoid robot industry. 3,000 engineers are working on technical problems every day, and more than 20 start-ups are incubated every year. Shanghai's humanoid robot industry chain covers all aspects from the research and development of core components to the manufacturing of complete machines, and then to the expansion of application scenarios.\n\n\"It is precisely because of the maturity of the upstream supply chain that we are able to build a humanoid robot in such a short time.\" Zhang Shaozheng, general manager of Zhiyuan Robot Manufacturing Department, introduced that the upstream precision processing links of many key components of humanoid robots overlap with new energy vehicles, and these precision components can be easily migrated to humanoid robot manufacturing.\n\nIn terms of application scenarios, humanoid robots in Shanghai have been widely used in every corner of life. In hospitals, humanoid robots serve as \"nurses\" to assist medical staff in caring for patients and provide them with caring services; in families, they serve as \"life assistants\" to help people clean and accompany the elderly and children; in automobile factories, humanoid robots serve as \"new employees\" to skillfully complete the assembly of parts and components, improving production efficiency and quality.\n\n\"In the future, humanoid robots will be as popular as smartphones,\" said Jiang Lei."

    "translation": "Humanoid robots, lined up in a square formation, danced flexibly, their movements were well-organized and in unison; mechanical arms, playing games and passing levels, were as steady as a rock...\n\nOn December 5, outside the venue of the 2023 China Robot Industry Development Conference, various robots showed off their skills on site. Many new technologies, new products, and new applications in the field of robotics added a technological touch to the conference.\n\nThe China Robot Industry Development Conference is a national industry conference hosted by the Robotics Branch of the China Machinery Industry Federation. It has been successfully held for 11 sessions since 2012. This year is the second time that the venue has been held in Wuhu after a lapse of 7 years.\n\nThe robotics industry is not only an emerging industry that integrates mechanical control, new generation information and communication technology, and artificial intelligence, but also a key industry supporting the digital and intelligent transformation of manufacturing and service industries.\nIn people's traditional impression, robots are mostly used for simple tasks such as handling, spraying, and assembly. However, as robot technology is updated, its application scenarios are becoming more and more diversified.\n\nWang Hong, deputy director of the Equipment Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, introduced that in recent years, industrial robots have shown a series of development, from high-speed, high-precision to high-load, high-reliability products have been launched, and the industrialization process of service and special robots has accelerated. In 2023 alone, 43 surgical robot products and systems have obtained medical device registration certificates from the National Medical Products Administration.\n\nAmong them, emerging industries such as new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaics are developing rapidly; traditional industries such as sanitary ware, ceramics, and hardware are accelerating their transformation; special needs such as fire fighting, drainage, search and rescue, and major projects such as the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge are driving the application of special robots.\n\nIn addition to manufacturing, robots in the service sector are also shining. A large number of service robots are employed in catering, tour guiding, logistics and other fields.\n\nAs of now, the number of industrial robots in service in my country has exceeded 1.5 million, accounting for more than one-third of the global total, and the density of manufacturing robots has reached 392 units per 10,000 people.\n\nThe rapid development of the robotics industry has injected new impetus into promoting the digitalization, networking and intelligent development of the manufacturing industry, provided new paths, and profoundly changed the manufacturing industry's production methods and industrial ecology.\n\nAccording to statistics, in 2022, my country's industrial robot production reached 443,000 units, a year-on-year increase of 21%. The global installed capacity of industrial robots was 553,000 units, a year-on-year increase of 5%, while my country's installed capacity reached 290,000 units, accounting for 52% of the global installed capacity. This shows that my country is not only the world's largest robot market, but also the world's largest robot producer.\nIn the final assembly workshop of Chery's New Energy Vehicle Phase IV Factory located in the south of Wuhu City, the quality inspection line is in order. After the final rain, dynamic and paint inspections, iCAR03 SUVs are rolling off the production line one after another.\n\nLi Nan, the production manager of iCAR03, told reporters that the workshop was just put into use in October and is in the ramp-up stage. Unlike traditional production lines, the automation rate is a highlight. The windshield, chassis, seats, and tires are all assembled by robots, which greatly saves manpower and improves efficiency.\n\nThis is just one scenario of intelligent application of robots in Wuhu.\n\nIn recent years, the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence has brought more possibilities to the robotics industry, making robots more \"intelligent\" and \"smarter\".\n\nThis conference coincides with the tenth anniversary of Wuhu being approved as the first national robotics industry cluster in the country.\n\nOver the past ten years, Wuhu's robotics industry has achieved development from \"nothing to something\" and \"from weak to strong\", and has realized a full industrial chain integrating industrial robots, service robots, system integration, artificial intelligence and special equipment, gathering more than 220 upstream and downstream enterprises, and its output value has exceeded 30 billion yuan.\n\nWuhu has won the National Best Robot Industrial Park Award for six consecutive years, ranked first in the Anhui Province Robot Industry Development Classification Assessment for five consecutive years, and ranked eighth in the country in terms of comprehensive strength of the robot industry. Undoubtedly, the robot industry has become a \"beautiful business card\" for Wuhu's industrial development.\n\nIn the view of Wuhu Municipal Party Committee Secretary Ningbo, the key to the development of the robotics and artificial intelligence industries currently lies in the support of computing power and data, which Wuhu has unique advantages in.\n\nToday, the Wuhu data center cluster is one of the top ten clusters of the country's \"East Data West Computing\" and has become the home of 14 key projects such as Huawei Cloud and the three major operators, with a total investment of more than 250 billion yuan. By the end of next year, the computing scale of the Wuhu data center cluster will exceed 10,000P, and will exceed 30,000P in the next five years, which will surely provide strong data support and computing power for the development of the robotics industry.\nAs an important equipment for new technologies and intelligent manufacturing, the robotics industry plays an important role in promoting the digital development of the manufacturing industry, intelligent upgrading, and the continuous application of new industries and new business formats.\n\nSu Bo, director of the National Intelligent Manufacturing Expert Committee, believes that in recent years, my country's robotics industry has achieved vigorous development, has been popularized in the manufacturing field, and has formed a relatively complete industrial chain, but the market share of domestic robots has always hovered around 30%.\n\nHe pointed out that some key parts of robots have made breakthroughs, but the supporting capabilities of system integration have not been formed. For example, in the welding and assembly production lines of new energy vehicles, foreign brand robots still dominate.\n\nSo, how can we achieve the popularization and application of robots? With the accelerated advancement of new industrialization, how can we make more fields enjoy the benefits of robots?\n\nSu Bo said that first of all, we must actively promote the improvement of key technical capabilities of robots, carry out joint research and development between industry, academia, research and application, speed up the filling of gaps in the industrial chain such as processing technology, and create more high-end and intelligent robot products.\n\nSecondly, we must accelerate the popularization and application of mature scenarios, promote the improvement of system integration capabilities of important production lines, and promote digital and intelligent transformation and upgrading of various industries and import substitution.\n\nIn the field of professional talent training, Liu Zhanshan, former executive vice president and secretary-general of the China Vocational Education Society, and Su Bo share the same ideas.\n\n\"The talent training model, educational content, and faculty level of vocational colleges must adapt to the needs of industry and enterprise development, and vigorously strengthen the construction of basic disciplines, new disciplines, and interdisciplinary disciplines.\" Liu Zhanshan said frankly that, in the final analysis, it is necessary to continuously improve original innovation capabilities and talent training quality, and provide talent support for solving key core technology problems in the development of the robotics industry.\n\nIn his opinion, only when the functions of robots are more diverse, the talent pool is more complete, and the application areas are further expanded, can we truly realize the goal of robots empowering thousands of industries."

    "translation": "In Jingzhou, Hubei, Midea's washing machine factory welcomed Midea's humanoid robots, which are engaged in inspection, machine operation and maintenance, equipment repair and other tasks; in Hanover, Germany, Shanghai Jieka intelligent collaborative robots made their debut at the Industrial Expo, demonstrating control capabilities at the level of lightly pinching potato chips, attracting many visitors to experience it; Beijing Geek+'s robot intelligent warehousing system has entered the supply chain of global major customers such as Siemens... Today, China's industrial robot products have been deeply applied in thousands of industries and are constantly growing.\n\nFrom stand-alone operation to cluster collaboration, from execution terminals to decision-making centers, from simple assembly to full localization... Through technological innovation, scene integration, and artificial intelligence empowerment, industrial robots are upgrading from traditional simple robotic arms to \"all-round players\" with cluster collaboration, intelligent decision-making, full-chain autonomy, and multi-domain empowerment.\n\nWith continuous breakthroughs in core technologies, domestic heavy-duty robots are ready to go\n\nTurning, stretching, waving arms... Walking into Midea's Blue Orange Laboratory (National Key Laboratory for High-end Heavy-duty Robots), orange Kuka six-axis industrial robots are lifting \"barbells\" of different weights and tirelessly performing \"Thomas full spins\". \"This is a test of the durability of the heavy-duty robot.\" Dr. Tuo Liheng, assistant to the laboratory director, told reporters that most of these robots use core components such as reducers and servo motors made in China.\n\nIn the laboratory, a sturdy iron-gray large industrial robot is particularly eye-catching. Tuo Liheng told reporters that this high-rigidity, high-precision, and high-reliability industrial robot is the latest scientific and technological achievement independently developed by KUKA. \"Although the load is 500 kilograms, the precision and rigidity of the whole machine are three times higher than those of traditional models.\"\n\n\"At present, robotics technology is moving from traditional industrial fields to a broad application market. Especially in strategic industries such as high-end manufacturing, aerospace, energy and medicine, the importance of high-rigidity, high-precision and high-reliability heavy-load robots as core equipment is becoming increasingly prominent.\" Chen Feng, general manager of Kuka China's corporate business, said that from 2015 to 2025, the market size of six-axis industrial robots with a load of 300 kilograms and above has increased tenfold.\n\nAfter acquiring Germany's Kuka in 2017, Midea has increased its R&D investment in common technologies and key components of heavy-duty robots, and has achieved localization of three core components: reducers, servo motors, and drive controls. Focusing on the full autonomy of heavy-duty robots, Midea's Blue Orange Laboratory has made breakthroughs in key technologies of core functional components such as heavy-duty RV reducers, heavy-duty servo motors, and new architecture controllers, and developed an anti-interference motion stiffness model, effectively solving the problems of heavy-duty robots in terms of accuracy and stiffness.\n\nIn the field of heavy-duty industrial robots, Chinese companies are making collective breakthroughs. Estun has launched a 700 kg industrial robot that can be widely used in heavy equipment, automobiles, building materials and other industries; Efort's latest heavy-duty robot has achieved batch sales of more than 100 units in 2024; Guangzhou CNC's series of heavy-duty robots with a maximum load of 500 kg have successfully passed my country's mandatory product certification.\n\n\"my country's industrial robot industry has shifted from importing core components to partially domestically produced products, and is accelerating towards complete domestic production.\" Chen Feng firmly believes that in the next two years, domestic heavy-duty industrial robots equipped with domestic RV reducers, servo motors, and controllers, and that are comparable to internationally renowned brands in terms of precision and reliability, will be put into mass production.\n\nBreak the market monopoly of international brands and achieve scale substitution in high-end scene applications\n\nWalking into the cab welding workshop of GAC Lingcheng heavy truck manufacturing base, six yellow Estun spot welding robots are working together - the robotic arms flip flexibly, and the welding guns rise and fall quickly between the cab frames, splashing fine welding sparks. After optimized design, each robot can quickly switch between handling and welding tasks through an automatic tool change system, greatly improving efficiency. At a production rate of 5 units per hour, the repetitive accuracy of the welds is stably controlled at ±0.08 mm, and the qualified rate continues to remain at 100%.\n\n\"In the past, all the robots in the factory were international brands, but this time we firmly chose domestically made ones.\" Du Shibin, director of GAC Lingcheng Manufacturing Center, told reporters that before selecting a supplier, the technical team had asked several suppliers to conduct trial welding and found that the welding quality of Estun robots was not inferior to some imported equipment, and the price was even more advantageous.\n\nMore importantly, Estun also has the ability to provide customized solutions based on segmented application scenarios. \"Estun also opened some core programs of the control system to us, and the two sides jointly developed optimization programs for the cab welding line and shared intellectual property rights,\" said Du Shibin.\n\nAnother company that has made breakthroughs in the field of automotive arc welding robots is Efort. In the welding workshop of BYD Hefei Factory, nearly 200 Efort ARC series arc welding robots work together in the welding stations of the front and rear subframes. \"These domestic robots equipped with self-developed jitter suppression algorithms have a stable welding repetitive positioning accuracy of ±0.03 mm, which is completely in line with the operating standards of international first-tier brands.\" A relevant person in charge of BYD Hefei Factory introduced that as of now, BYD has deployed nearly 1,000 Efort arc welding robots in eight major bases.\n\n\"The localization of arc welding robots is not a simple replacement, but a full-stack innovation from process packages, core components to control systems.\" You Wei, chairman and general manager of Efort Intelligent Robot Co., Ltd., gave an example, saying that Efort has made breakthroughs in the key core technologies of high-performance arc welding robots and their components/software, and has formed a series of high-precision RV reducer products, special lubricants/greases, high-performance special servo motors, application process packages and operating systems with completely independent intellectual property rights. The overall performance has reached the international advanced level, the autonomy rate exceeds 96%, and some have achieved 100% autonomy and control.\n\nThe large-scale replacement of international brands in high-end scene applications is due to the improvement of the precision, reliability and durability of domestic industrial robots. Recently, the \"Autonomous Intelligent Arc Welding Robot Technology and System\" project, a key special project of the National Key R&D Program \"Intelligent Robots\", has been launched. This new project led by EFORT can achieve a welding robot precision of 0.5 mm, and the level of intelligent welding will reach a new level.\n\nWhile achieving breakthroughs in high-end scenarios, the application of industrial robots in my country is also expanding in breadth. Statistics show that my country's industrial robot output will reach 556,400 units in 2024, a year-on-year increase of 14.2%. The latest data from the International Federation of Robotics shows that China will install 276,000 new industrial robots in 2023, accounting for 51% of the global total. Following the automotive and 3C electronics industries, general industrial fields such as new energy, sanitary ceramics, metal processing, furniture and home appliances have begun to become the new market mainstay of China's industrial robots.\n\nArtificial intelligence is accelerating its integration, from \"single machine intelligence\" to \"group intelligence\"\n\nIn Shandong Zoucheng Luoshi Intelligent Manufacturing Industrial Park, a collaborative robot equipped with force and vision sensors is accurately demonstrating the assembly of a computer USB interface. The robot arm is endowed with human touch and vision. During the plug-in process, it senses the contact force in real time, dynamically adjusts the angle and force, and demonstrates anthropomorphic operations such as \"oblique touch correction\" and \"secondary alignment\".\n\n\"This robot combines force control search and visual servo technology, and is capable of micron-level precision assembly.\" Tuo Hua, founder and CEO of Luoshi Robotics, introduced that starting from 2023, the company will implement the \"Robot + AI\" strategy, enhance the robot's perception and decision-making capabilities through artificial intelligence technology, and achieve breakthrough applications in 3C electronics, automotive parts and other fields. \"The deep integration of underlying control technology and AI is the key to intelligent upgrading.\"\n\nIn a large overseas warehouse, 700 autonomous mobile robots from Beijing Geek+ Technology Co., Ltd. shuttled through a 20,000 square meter space at a speed of 2 meters per second. They worked in collaboration with 40 multifunctional workstations, completely overturning the traditional \"people looking for goods\" model - shelves automatically flowed to workstations, robotic arms accurately grabbed goods, and autonomous mobile robots quickly transported goods along dynamically planned paths. The entire warehouse processed more than 350,000 pieces of goods per day, and the peak efficiency of a single workstation reached 500 pieces per hour.\n\n\"There are no fixed work partitions here. Business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) orders are processed together, and all categories of goods such as clothing and electronics share storage space.\" Geek+ Chief Technology Officer Li Hongbo explained that through the \"hybrid storage algorithm\" and \"dynamic path planning system\", the robot cluster can adjust task priorities in real time to avoid congestion, and can flexibly adjust the scale of operations to easily cope with demand peaks during promotional activities.\n\nBreakthroughs in technologies such as swarm intelligent control and dynamic path planning have promoted the transition of industrial mobile robots from \"single-machine intelligence\" to \"system intelligence\", enabling Geek+ to have the technical capability to dispatch more than 5,000 robots with a single system. It has also built more than 10 \"thousand-unit-level\" robot smart warehouse demonstration projects around the world, maintaining the top global market share in the field of smart warehousing for six consecutive years, with overseas business revenue accounting for more than 75%.\n\nThe deep integration of industrial robots and artificial intelligence enables flexible production and intelligent collaboration through adaptive environmental perception, continuous self-learning optimization, and human-like decision-making capabilities, greatly improving manufacturing efficiency and flexibility, and is an important driving force for promoting intelligent manufacturing.\n\nChen Feng provided another perspective on the development potential of \"artificial intelligence + industrial robots\". \"At present, the market capacity of industrial robots in my country is about 300,000 units, and its business model is customized development, installation and debugging by professionals, and even accompanying workers and production. If the market capacity reaches 1 million units per year in the future, the demand for installation, debugging, and operation and maintenance personnel will increase significantly.\" Chen Feng said that industrial robots come with artificial intelligence when they leave the factory, and out-of-the-box, one-click installation, and predictive maintenance are all market demands and will become a reality."

The so-called embodied intelligence, simply put, is artificial intelligence with a physical body that can interact with the environment. This technology mainly studies how to enable robots to have human-like perception, planning, decision-making and behavioral capabilities. As an important part of the development of new quality productivity, what impact will embodied intelligence have on our production and life? When can humanoid robots really enter the homes of ordinary people? Let's take a look at the reporter's visit and investigation.\nSomersaults, martial arts, serving tea, screwing in factories... This year, humanoid robots have become popular with their amazing movements. The smooth and natural movements are the result of precise control of every muscle. In a science and technology park in Wuzhong District, Suzhou, the robot \"Xiaomi\" is preparing for the humanoid robot half marathon to be held in Beijing.\n\nThis humanoid robot, released this year, has been able to walk and run like a normal human after more than two months of unremitting practice. To achieve natural and smooth movements, it relies on the coordinated control of more than 30 automatic motors in its body, which are the core components of the \"skeleton\" structure of the humanoid robot.\nThe evolution of robots is not limited to more developed limbs, but also to smarter brains. In March, a humanoid robot company released its latest model. In the video released to the public, it can not only complete difficult operations such as riding a bicycle and sewing grapes, but also achieve millisecond-level interactive reactions due to its multimodal interactive large model, making judgments and responses through human facial expressions and voice intonation.\n\nIn a 3,000-square-meter embodied intelligence \"data factory\" in Zhangjiang, Shanghai, more than 100 embodied intelligent robots are shuttling between homes, restaurants, and other scenes. They are manually controlled and combined with the country's first universal embodied base large model for enhanced training, making the robots smarter and closer to people's real lives.\nWhen artificial intelligence technology is deeply integrated with robotics technology, machines will have the ability to perceive, understand and act in the physical world. This ability is called embodied intelligence, and humanoid robots are the key carriers of embodied intelligence. With the widespread application of large models, embodied intelligence technology has ushered in new breakthroughs, and humanoid robots have also entered a critical development period of concentrated technological breakthroughs and initial application trials.\nXu Yangsheng, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen: \"The first characteristic is that the machine has the ability to move, such as walking and jumping. The second characteristic is that the machine has the ability to perceive, such as being able to see whether something is red, blue or green, and being able to touch something furry or cold. The third characteristic is that the machine has the ability to think, such as being able to understand the world and make decisions. The combination of these three functions is what we call embodied intelligence. This era has just begun, because computing power is increasing, data is increasing, and there is endless data. When the thinking function of the machine is improved, it will imitate humans and learn from them.\"\n\nAt this year's two sessions, it was proposed to establish a mechanism for the growth of investment in future industries and cultivate future industries such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied intelligence, and 6G. In the industry's view, embodied intelligence has become an important direction for my country to cultivate future industries and a \"key area\" for global scientific and technological competition and cooperation.\n\nXu Yangsheng: \"China is a manufacturing powerhouse. Embodied intelligence involves not only software but also everything in the manufacturing industry. It is very important to promote the development of China's manufacturing industry. Embodied intelligence is a comprehensive project. If our embodied intelligence can be developed, it can drive the entire industry, including manufacturing, electronics, power, machinery, and software engineering.\"\nIn February this year, the international investment bank Goldman Sachs released a research report that the humanoid robot industry is at a critical stage from research and development to large-scale production. With a complete manufacturing system and a broad application market, China is expected to achieve breakthroughs in specific segments. At present, there are more than 20 cities in China that have explicitly proposed the development of embodied intelligence. Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou lead the country as a whole with their comprehensive advantages in technology, industry, and ecology. According to statistics, Shenzhen has more than 57,000 robot-related companies, ranking first among cities in the country, and the total output value of the industrial chain exceeds 170 billion yuan. Many embodied intelligence and humanoid robot companies are gathered in Nanshan District, where high-rise buildings are everywhere.\n\nA service humanoid robot was just released not long ago and will be used in hotels in the future. Unlike the common hotel service robots we have now, it has a pair of dexterous hands that can not only grab express and takeaways, but also press the elevator by itself.\nThis is the third product developed by the robot company in half a year. The efficient development speed depends not only on its own R&D strength, but also on the supply chain advantages brought by the industrial cluster. In Shenzhen, the localization rate of leading humanoid robot companies exceeds 90%, and the localization rate of the industrial chain supply chain exceeds 60%. Especially in Nanshan District, the closed loop from robot design to mass production can be basically completed within a radius of 10 kilometers.\n\nIndustrial collaboration is not only the gathering of physical space, but also the \"chemical reaction\" of technology, capital and talents. A robotics company established less than four years ago, with R&D personnel accounting for more than 70%, uses its self-developed embodied intelligence engine as the technical foundation, specializing in the robot's vision and brain, allowing traditional robotic arms to have judgment close to that of humans. Relying on the manufacturing industry ecology of the Pearl River Delta, they have already implemented many applications in the field of intelligent manufacturing in the industrial field.\nWith the surge in popularity of embodied intelligence, especially humanoid robots, in recent years, many robot companies have accelerated their investment in product R&D. Since last year, the company has no longer been limited to the development of the \"brain\", but has moved towards the development and overall implementation of general humanoid robots. In addition, they now receive several visits and surveys from institutions and investors from all over the country almost every day.\n\nThe development and maturity of emerging industries and future industries generally go through a process from technological breakthroughs to \"cost revolution\" and then to large-scale commercialization. Overall, although embodied intelligence technology has been applied on a small scale in some fields, it still faces multiple challenges from the independent control of core technologies to the collaborative innovation of the industrial chain and the exploration of business models. Humanoid robots are still a long way from entering thousands of households.\nReal needs and scenario applications are the key to determining whether humanoid robots can move from the laboratory to large-scale mass production. How to avoid repeated investment by enterprises and achieve efficient integration of resources and collaborative innovation breakthroughs has become an important direction for various regions to explore.\nAs a platform, Shenzhen Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Research Institute conducts technical research around common industry problems and actively helps robot companies find more real application scenarios, which can not only quickly improve the intelligence level of different industries, but also collect more real data for application scenarios for robot companies. At present, Zhang Jianguo and his team are studying how to optimize the algorithm and provide power supply security services for the Southern Power Grid by adding dexterous hands to humanoid robots. If all goes well, these humanoid robots will participate in the work of power supply security together with power inspection personnel at the National Games held in November this year.\n\nShenzhen is working hard to build a public service platform matrix to attract more upstream and downstream enterprises, scientific research institutions, and innovation teams to join and form a more complete industrial ecology. Shenzhen has recently released a three-year action plan for technological innovation and industrial development of embodied intelligent robots, proposing to cultivate more than 10 companies with a valuation of over 10 billion yuan in the field of embodied intelligence, to achieve a scale of more than 100 billion yuan in related industries, and to have more than 1,200 companies related to the embodied intelligent robot industry cluster.\n\nZhang Lin, Director of the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Bureau: \"We will provide all-round support to enterprises around key core technology research, factor supply, data collection, scenario supply, talent policy support, etc. The goal is also very clear, which is to seize the major juncture and opportunity of this wave of embodied intelligence development, and use two to three years in Shenzhen and the Greater Bay Area to cultivate a trillion-scale embodied intelligence industry cluster that serves China and even the world.\"\n\nAt present, embodied intelligence is moving from single-point breakthroughs to industrial collaboration, from \"barbaric growth\" to \"ecological co-construction\", and opening a new stage of ecological development. Technological innovation and industrial innovation are the basic paths to develop new quality productivity. Seamless connection between the innovation chain and the industrial chain is the key to stimulating the innovative vitality of enterprises and the focus of policy efforts. In the new track of embodied intelligence, which belongs to the future industry, in this technological and industrial transformation, China is running hard with an open attitude and innovative spirit."

    "translation": "Robots walk on the catwalk and enter factories to assist in car manufacturing. Robots are helping in education, medical care, urban management and other fields. Today, robots have been widely used and have entered into your and my lives.\n\nWith the rapid development of technology, the robotics industry is accelerating its \"intelligence\" and innovation. Especially since this year, from the central government to local governments, a series of arrangements have been made to cultivate embodied intelligence and develop intelligent robots. The policy side and the market side resonate at the same frequency, the new track is gradually opening up, and the industry is developing in full swing.\n\nSome institutions predict that during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, the scale of my country's robot industry will grow to about 400 billion yuan. The future is here and the opportunities are endless.\nBefore the May Day holiday, intelligent robots were put on duty at the Bibo Island Resort in Jinhai Lake, Pinggu, Beijing. Cruising, guiding, and interacting with tourists, cultural tourism has a new way of opening up.\n\nThe person in charge of the Bibo Island Resort said that intelligent robots make tourism more \"smart and interesting\", and also help with the refined management of scenic spots, adding \"smart\" power to the cultural and tourism industry.\n\nFrom participating in marathons to working more intelligently in factories, robots are becoming increasingly popular this spring, and the entire industry is on the cusp of the trend.\nOn March 11, Zhiyuan Robotics released the Lingxi X2, a bipedal intelligent interactive humanoid robot that integrates functions such as movement, interaction, and operation; just one day later, on March 12, UBTECH and the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center jointly released a full-size humanoid robot for scientific research and education, which is scheduled to start delivery in the second quarter.\n\nFrom professional exhibitions, we can more intuitively feel the \"concentration\" of innovation. Take the recent Robot Industry Linkage Conference held in Shenzhen as an example, industrial robots have achieved the upgrade from \"mechanical arms\" to \"smart brains\", collaborative robots have demonstrated intelligent operation solutions, from \"dexterous hands\" to \"electronic skin\", and participating companies have shown their \"unique skills\" and kept refreshing the screen.\nThe market is full of new products, and the production boom is surging. The sales of \"electronic skin\" has increased 10 times, the orders for direct-drive motors in January have exceeded half of last year, and the new generation of smart elderly care robots are popular in the market... In Songshan Lake, Dongguan, Guangdong, many robot companies have won a large number of orders.\n\nIn the first quarter, my country's output of industrial robots and service robots reached 149,000 sets and 2.604 million sets, up 26% and 20% year-on-year respectively.\n\n\"I have to look at and search for projects almost every week to learn about the latest trends.\" A head of a venture capital institution lamented that current innovation in robots \"is not measured in years, but in days.\"\n\nTake the robot \"Tornado Boy\" that just finished a marathon as an example. Its previous generation product learned to walk in May 2024, run in June, complete double-leg and single-leg jumping in July, and start dancing skills in October... The \"growth\" speed is beyond imagination.\nNot only humanoid robots, but also industrial robots and service robots are making great strides forward.\n\nIn the painting room of the assembly line of China First Tractor, the chassis painting operation of the tractor is in progress: the mechanical arm can be seen turning flexibly, and the error of the paint film thickness is controlled at the millimeter level. The technician told reporters that after integrating intelligent technology and 3D models, the mechanical arm can automatically generate the spraying path and adjust the parameters according to the temperature and humidity on site. \"Industrial robots are already able to sense changes in the production environment and realize the self-adaptation of intelligent processes.\"\n\nMore than a thousand mobile operating robots are used in aerospace, semiconductor and other manufacturing links; explosion-proof industrial robots are used on a large scale in the manufacturing of rail transit equipment and other links; surgical robots assist in completing complex remote surgeries... Behind each landmark breakthrough is a reflection of the industry's move towards new quality improvement.\nmy country has set up a 60 billion yuan national artificial intelligence fund to speed up the layout of investment projects; the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has promoted the supply and demand docking and promotion and application of \"robot +\" to enhance the resilience of the industrial chain; the central and local governments have jointly built innovation centers such as embodied intelligent robots and humanoid robots to promote industrial agglomeration...\n\nChongqing proposed to promote the research and development of core technologies around \"storage and computing in one\" chips, and Beijing announced that it will release more than 10,000 robot application opportunities within two years. Many places across the country have taken active actions to deepen and implement the layout from the research and development side to the application side.\n\nThe report released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology predicts that during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, the penetration rate of industrial robots in my country will increase significantly, service robots will continue to evolve, and humanoid robots will shift from being resource-driven to being market-driven.\n\n\"On the one hand, new technologies are accelerating industrial iterations, and on the other hand, the transformation of manufacturing and service industries is creating huge space. The domestic robotics industry has entered a period of rapid development,\" said Song Xiaogang, Secretary-General of the China Machinery Industry Federation.\nBehind the popularity of robots is the accumulation of strength of the entire industrial chain.\n\nThe reporter’s investigation found that the domestic robot manufacturing system is becoming more and more complete, from materials and parts to electronic systems and final assembly integration, which has strongly supported the industry’s pursuit of innovation and change.\n\nWalking into the production workshop of Suzhou Green Harmonic Drive Technology Co., Ltd., you will see robotic arms taking out raw materials from the operating box, processing, testing, cleaning, and oiling them to make the flexible wheel in the harmonic reducer.\nHarmonic reducers are called the \"joints\" of robots. They have extremely high requirements for technology and craftsmanship and have long been monopolized by foreign countries. This \"little giant\" company continues to overcome technical difficulties such as material selection and flexible bearings to control the transmission error within 10 arc seconds. Zhang Yuwen, general manager of Green Harmonic, said that the company is targeting the new trend of embodied intelligence and developing integrated robot joints to provide support for building more complex robot systems.\n\nFrom domestic breakthroughs to domestic substitution, today, domestic harmonic reducers have accounted for more than 40% of the domestic market share.\n\nIt is not just the reducer. In recent years, my country has continued to strengthen and supplement the entire robot industry chain: identify weak links, make systematic arrangements around strengthening core technology research, etc.; launch the \"unveiling the list and appointing the leaders\" campaign for cutting-edge fields and key links in the industry, and post a list of talents; from technology enterprise incubators to the first unit (set), first batch, first edition and other promotion and application support policies, we will connect production, education, research and application, and unite the industry to jointly tackle the shortcomings of the industry.\n\nBreakthroughs at each point have effectively enhanced the resilience of the chain. With the acceleration of the localization process of key links, China's \"Iron Man\" has a more solid support.\n\nLooking at the industry, innovation on the chain is \"blooming in many places\"——\n\nThe mass-produced 5-finger dexterous hand of Zhejiang Lingqiao Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. realizes accurate measurement and fine perception of the environment and operating objects; the high-performance servo motor of Leadshine Intelligent improves the robot's motion control capabilities; the high-energy density battery of CATL can provide more powerful power for the robot... From robotic arms, sensors to batteries, and body manufacturing, domestic suppliers play an important role in almost every part of the robot.\n\"We are growing together with domestic brands.\" In the interview, many business leaders expressed this view.\n\nThe density of robots in my country's manufacturing industry has reached 470 per 10,000 workers, and the huge manufacturing industry provides rich scenarios for industrial applications. In recent years, the advantageous industries represented by the \"new three things\" have grown stronger, and the voice of the industrial chain has been enhanced, which has led to a number of domestic robots being put into use. The market experience has accelerated the growth of domestic suppliers.\n\nThis is a scene in Shenzhen Nanshan \"Robot Valley\": Pasini's tactile sensors can be directly supplied to UBTECH across the street, and the simulation data of Cross-Dimension Intelligence can be input into Zhifang's training system in real time. From laser radar, robotic arms, to dexterous hands, the supply chain is right at the doorstep, and the synergy effect of \"R&D in the morning, testing in the afternoon, and iteration at night\" is beginning to emerge.\n\n\"my country has formed a full industrial chain layout of robots covering all upstream and downstream fields, and the autonomy rate, product competitiveness, and penetration rate of key industries have been further improved.\" Song Hongjun, a senior researcher at the State Investment and Merchants Advanced Manufacturing Industry Research Institute, said that although there are still bottlenecks such as motion control algorithms and high-precision sensors, and some links have not been fundamentally solved, the synergy of policies and markets has promoted the in-depth layout of the industrial chain. \"The robotics industry is undergoing a qualitative change from 'parts assembly' to 'smart symbiosis'.\"\n\nRobotics is an emerging industry and a key industry supporting digital upgrades. In the face of the rapid technological competition, we must take the initiative and seize the opportunity.\nWalking into the humanoid robot data training center located in Beijing’s Shougang Park, we saw engineers wearing wearable devices and using remote control to control robots to accurately complete actions such as watering, arranging flowers, and folding clothes.\n\nZhang Qinfeng, director of the center, told reporters that high-quality data sets are the gateway for robots to understand the world. An important task at present is to speed up the \"density\" of practical training, quickly accumulate data, and promote evolution and upgrading.\n\nEmpowering with \"numbers\" to create a \"smart brain\" for robots——\n\nSince the beginning of this year, many places have announced to strengthen the construction of embodied intelligence training centers, aiming at the problem of data shortage, and \"robot technical schools\" and \"data factories\" have been accelerated. At the same time, the industry is also exploring new technologies and expanding new ways to obtain data.\n\nBeijing Galaxy General Robotics Co., Ltd. attempts to train robots with data produced by physical simulators through synthetic data-driven technology. Wang He, the company's founder, said that it has accumulated tens of millions of scene data and billions of action data.\n\nMa Jian, CEO of Jingtai Technology, said that the intelligent autonomous experiment platform developed by the company can increase data collection capabilities by 40 times. It has deployed more than 300 robotic experiment stations and accumulated a large amount of standardized, high-quality experimental data.\n\nIn addition, the digital \"foundation\" is also being further consolidated. The National Bureau of Data has made it clear that it will systematically promote the construction of a national integrated computing network and promote the interconnection of regional and industry data infrastructure. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has proposed that it will strengthen the research and development layout of general large models and industry large models and accelerate the construction of high-quality data sets in the industrial field.\n\n\"Wherever the 'AI+' action goes, the construction and promotion of high-quality data sets must go there.\" A relevant person in charge of the National Data Bureau said that they will fully mobilize the forces of all sectors of society to continuously increase data supply.\n\nAiming at the future, strengthening basic research and forward-looking layout——\n\nIn the Shanghai \"Mosu Space\" large model innovation ecological community, Wuwen Xinqiong uses its self-developed technology to achieve the coordinated operation of multiple large model algorithms on multiple chips; Xiyu Technology continues to make breakthroughs in multimodal large model technology and accelerate the development of AI intelligent bodies... The \"going up and down the stairs is upstream and downstream\" model here promotes the cooperation of resident companies from underlying technology, application research and development, scenario design and other links, and a number of cutting-edge technologies are emerging rapidly.\nIn Yizhuang, Beijing, the National and Local Co-constructed Embodied Intelligent Robot Innovation Center released the universal embodied intelligent platform \"Huisi Kaiwu\", which realizes the compatibility of a single software system on multi-configuration bodies such as robotic arms and wheeled robots. The technical achievements will be open to the industry, drawing on the strengths of many people and accelerating the joint efforts to tackle key common technologies.\nTowards high-quality development, the robotics industry still has many problems to solve. For example, there are shortcomings in basic theoretical research and basic technology research; the hardware cost of humanoid robots is relatively high, which restricts large-scale application.\n\nFrom AI model bases to high-computing chips, from brain-like intelligence to next-generation communications, the industry and academia are increasing cross-disciplinary and cross-field integration and innovation, actively integrating industrial resources, and working together to explore and tackle key problems.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, my country took the lead in formulating and releasing the world's first international standard for elderly care robots; not long ago, the first batch of national standards in the technical requirements series for humanoid robots were approved... Establishing standards and establishing norms are constantly pushing the industry forward steadily.\n\"In this 'long-distance race' to cultivate new quality productivity, we must not only strengthen the supply of science and technology, but also work hard in strategic planning, talent training, etc., especially optimizing the industrial layout and strengthening standardized construction.\" Xiong Youjun, general manager of the National and Local Co-built Embodied Intelligent Robot Innovation Center, said that only by taking more steady and solid steps can every \"small step\" forward of the robot become a \"big step\" to promote industrial development, and achieve the leap from \"running a half marathon\" to \"running\" into the future."

    "translation": "From commercial services to intelligent manufacturing, from accompanying the elderly to counting goods and running stores... the manufacturing of humanoid robots is \"accelerating\", when will it become part of the lives of ordinary people?\n\nHumanoid robots, also known as humanoid robots, bionic robots, etc., usually have a head, torso, arms and legs, etc., and are as close to humans as possible in structure and function, and have certain motor and perception abilities.\n\nNowadays, humanoid robots are becoming a new trend.\n\nThis year, Beijing will host the World Humanoid Robot Games and the Robot Half Marathon.\n\nAccording to incomplete statistics from the Industrial Research Institute of Shenzhen New Strategy Media Co., Ltd., as of June 2024, there are more than 160 humanoid robot manufacturers in the world, of which more than 60 are Chinese companies, making China the country with the largest number of humanoid robot manufacturers in the world.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, the global humanoid robot market will have a compound annual growth rate of 71% from 2021 to 2030. The China Institute of Electronics predicts that by 2030, China's humanoid robot market is expected to reach about 870 billion yuan.\n\nAt present, the mainstream humanoid robots on the market are expensive, with prices exceeding 100,000 yuan, and even exceeding 500,000 yuan. Many people believe that humanoid robots have limited functions and are expensive, so why is the layout of related industries accelerating?\n\nIndustry insiders said that the popularity of humanoid robots is closely related to factors such as technological development, market demand and policy promotion.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of humanoid robots in environmental perception and human-machine interaction. The development of hardware technology has also promoted the improvement of humanoid robots' capabilities in motion control and other aspects.\n\nAt the World Robot Conference held in Beijing last year, the GALBOT G1 universal humanoid robot produced by Beijing Galaxy General Robot Co., Ltd. picked up goods from the shelves and delivered them accurately to customers after hearing voice commands. The robot is expected to be initially used in commercial scenarios such as unmanned pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\nFrom the perspective of market demand, the aging population and labor shortage have greatly expanded the application scenarios of humanoid robots.\n\nUse an air fryer to fry French fries, make salad burgers, brew coffee, briefly soothe children, fold clothes... These scenes at the 2024 World Robot Conference allow people to see more possibilities for humanoid robots to enter daily life.\n\nThe attention given at the national strategic level has also become a strong driving force for the accelerated development of my country's humanoid robot industry.\n\nIn January 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and seven other departments issued an implementation opinion on promoting the innovative development of future industries, proposing to strengthen future high-end equipment, among which humanoid robots ranked first in the \"innovative iconic products\" column. In recent years, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and many other places have also proposed to focus on cultivating future industries such as humanoid robots.\n\nLeng Xiaokun, chairman of Leju (Shenzhen) Robotics Technology Co., Ltd., believes that the greatest significance of humanoid robots in the industrial field is that companies do not need to transform production lines for mechanization. \"During our visits, we found that there are still a lot of links in factory scenes that rely on manual labor and cannot be solved by industrial robots. Humanoid robots can be adapted to existing production lines 1:1 and can be put into use without modification.\"\n\nHowever, in the factory sector, humanoid robots are still in the small-scale trial stage, and only a small number of advanced factories have begun to explore their use in certain work processes. It is still too early to achieve large-scale replacement of humans.\n\nIndustry insiders predict that more humanoid robots may enter production lines in the next three to five years; but truly entering people's lives will require higher precision and safety, and it will take longer.\n\nYao Qiyuan, founder and marketing director of Shenzhen Zhongqing Robot Technology Co., Ltd., suggested that the relevant standards for humanoid robots should be improved as soon as possible, and application scenarios should be continuously opened up so that humanoid robots can be \"applied first.\"\n\n\"Compared with foreign countries, China has richer application scenarios, which is conducive to the full training of humanoid robots. We look forward to policies, technologies, and demands jointly promoting the development of the humanoid robot industry.\" Leng Xiaokun said."

    "translation": "People's Daily Online, Munich, July 1 (Reporter Liu Zhonghua) The 2025 Munich International Robotics and Automation Expo\nwas recently held at the Munich Exhibition Center in Germany. The exhibition is held every two years and is an industry event for\nglobal robotics and automation solutions, presenting the entire automation industry chain from single components to complete systems,\nfrom specific applications to related services. This exhibition has a total of about 900 exhibitors from 40 countries. While visiting\nthe exhibition, Bavaria's Minister of Economic Affairs Aiwanger said, \"Robotics and automation will completely change our production\nprocesses. In particular, the integration of artificial intelligence will open up a series of new possibilities.\"\nMore than 100 Chinese robot companies participated in this robot exhibition, showcasing the latest progress of China's intelligent\nmanufacturing on the international stage.

    "translation": "\"In the next one to two years, robots will have simple, generalized commercial and household capabilities such as tidying up rooms and delivering items.\" Wang Xingxing, founder of Chinese robot company Yushu Technology, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters recently that the company has been continuously improving the operational capabilities of robots in recent years so that robots can \"work\" for humans.\n\n\"In the past year, we have upgraded the operating capabilities of the robot arms, such as assembling parts and opening doors, so that robots can help humans free themselves from heavy labor,\" said Wang Xingxing.\n\n\nIn January this year, Yushu Technology's humanoid robot, wearing a little red coat and holding a red handkerchief, danced the Yangko on the Spring Festival Gala stage and quickly became popular. In May, the world's first fighting competition with humanoid robots as the main participants was held in Hangzhou, and Yushu Technology's humanoid robots presented many \"famous scenes\" in the fighting competition on the ring.\n\nWhile humanoid robots demonstrate their technological capabilities through performance activities such as dancing and fighting, they also spark discussions on the practicality of the technology, commercialization paths and industry bubbles.\n\nIn this regard, Wang Xingxing believes that before the \"ultimate goal\" of humanoid robots entering production and life is achieved, performances can demonstrate the true development of robots and generate some commercial value.\n\n\"The robot fighting competition uses our latest generation of control technology. The robots are able to complete complex combination movements such as punching and roundhouse kicking. The movements are smoothly connected and the stability is good.\" Wang Xingxing said that in the future, robot fighting competitions are also expected to become a globally popular sporting event like football and basketball.\n\nYushu Technology launched the humanoid robot project in 2023. Thanks to its long-term technological accumulation in the field of quadruped robots, it took only half a year to launch the first bipedal robot.\n\nBased on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the humanoid robot launched by Yushu Technology in 2024 has the flexibility beyond that of ordinary people and can perform difficult dynamic movements. This year, humanoid robots have \"learned\" kung fu, somersaults, and somersaults through AI technologies such as data capture and reinforcement learning, which has attracted widespread attention.\n\nRepresented by Yushu Technology, \"Chinese power\" is rising in the global arena of humanoid robots. Morgan Stanley's research report \"Humanoid Robots 100: Mapping the Humanoid Robot Value Chain\" recently released predicts that by 2050, the scale of China's humanoid robot market will reach 6 trillion yuan, and the total number of humanoid robots will reach 59 million units.\n\nData released by China's State Administration for Market Regulation show that as of the end of December 2024, there were 451,700 intelligent robot industry enterprises in China, with a total registered capital of 6,444.57 billion yuan. The number of enterprises increased by 206.73% from the end of 2020 and by 19.39% from the end of 2023, showing a steady upward trend.\n\nIn March this year, humanoid robots entered 5G smart factories in China to carry out collaborative training of multiple robots, multiple scenarios and multiple tasks. When will humanoid robots really move from the stage to the workshop and even the living room?\n\n\"At present, the large-scale and batch use of robots still requires further breakthroughs in software and hardware.\" Wang Xingxing said that if hardware and AI are compared to the body and brain of a robot, humanoid robots need to achieve low cost and reliable performance while pursuing lightweight hardware. The greater challenge lies in the large AI model.\n\n\"It will take some time before humanoid robots enter production spaces and family life's 'ChatGPT' moment arrives.\" Wang Xingxing said that robot manufacturers and research institutions at home and abroad are exploring through different paths and are currently on the \"eve\" of a breakthrough.\n\nIn Wang Xingxing's view, humanoid robots will take the lead in opening up the industrial and commercial fields. He said that the birth of AI and general robotics technology will promote a new round of \"industrial revolution\", and will also change and even reconstruct production relations and human-machine ethics. It is necessary to think ahead about the improvement of the legal and regulatory system, the safety of human-machine collaboration, and the reshaping of labor skills.\n\n\"Since I was a child, I have wanted to use technology to change the world. Just as the name 'Yushu Technology' represents more than just a company, I hope to light up a 'technology tree' that flourishes in the vast universe,\" he said."

    "translation": "With a light touch, the garden mode is set, and the robot moves forward at a constant speed along the S-shaped trajectory. Wherever it sweeps, the grass clippings are evenly laid out in a straight line... Chinese-branded smart lawn mowing robots are becoming a powerful assistant for overseas customers in taking care of their country gardens.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, the performance of many companies engaged in robot or garden equipment manufacturing, such as Ninebot, Ecovacs, Greebo, and Daye Group, has grown rapidly, among which overseas sales of smart lawn mowing robots have become a new highlight.\n\nWhy are domestic lawn mower robots so popular overseas? What are the technical advantages of Chinese companies? The reporter conducted an interview.\n\n\n\nLawn mowing robots are popular in Europe and the United States\n\nHoffman, who lives in Lower Saxony, Germany, said that his lawn is quite large and needs to be cleaned frequently. When buying a lawn mower robot, he compared prices from three different stores and found that European brands were generally more expensive and after-sales service was not completely localized, so he finally chose the Chinese brand Ecovacs.\n\n\"In Germany, the Ecovacs lawn mower robot already has a stable after-sales system, and its design is in line with the habits of European users. I also really like the path planning of this robot. For example, it does not 'randomly walk', but covers the lawn in a structured manner, which is more efficient. My wife said that I finally don't have to push the lawn mower every weekend,\" said Hoffman.\n\nIt is understood that in many countries such as Europe and the United States, there are large numbers of home lawns. Since the 1970s, gasoline-powered lawn mowers have become a common tool for garden maintenance in many regions. However, as people's environmental awareness increases and the pace of work accelerates, traditional \"gasoline-powered + hand-push\" lawn mowers are gradually becoming unable to meet demand. This change has brought strong demand for the development of the lawn mowing robot industry, and related Chinese brand companies have begun to actively embrace this market.\n\n\"There are a large number of suburban residences in Europe, America and Australia, with large courtyards and low population density. Traditional manual mowing is inefficient and costly. Using smart mowing robots can greatly save labor, time and money.\" Zhu Fanghao, senior vice president of Anker Innovations Technology Co., Ltd. and head of the eufy business unit, said that the use scenarios of mowing robots cover residential courtyards, park green spaces and small public landscape areas, which can meet different needs from 200 square meters to 4,000 square meters, adapt to different slopes, and effectively bypass obstacles such as flower beds, swimming pools and trees. Not only that, in these areas, lawn maintenance has been integrated into the housing value system, forming a mature consumer environment with a high retention rate.\n\nThe aging of the population, the accelerated pace of life, and the increased demand for outdoor space are also important factors driving the growth in demand for lawn mowing robots.\n\n\"Our GOAT series products have entered many markets such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, etc., and are serving local consumers through more channels. Thanks to the intelligent operation experience, related products are very popular. From the perspective of the European market, this year's sales are expected to more than double that of last year.\" said An Zhongjun, head of Ecovacs Europe.\n\n\"Electrification, low carbonization and intelligence are important directions for the development of the industry. Mowing equipment has also evolved from the stage of 'manual pre-buried wires' to 'automated, intelligent and unmanned', which has opened up huge growth space for the development of mowing robots.\" Wu Junliang, general manager of Shanghai Woshi Industrial Co., Ltd., which is expanding its business in the United States, said. Relevant forecasts show that by 2028, the global market size of mowing robots will reach about 4 billion US dollars.\n\nTechnological breakthroughs significantly optimize user experience\n\nWhy are lawn mowing robots produced in China so popular overseas?\n\nExcellent product performance is an important factor. On the Amazon platform, lawn mower robots produced by Chinese companies have received a lot of positive reviews, among which \"easy to install and operate\", \"automatic obstacle avoidance accuracy\" and \"excellent performance\" ranked in the top three.\n\n\"In 2018, the lawn mower I bought required laying cables, which was a very time-consuming process. Now, the eufy E18 lawn mower robot produced by Anker can start working directly after charging. It is very easy to operate, which is amazing! If new grass grows in the yard that was not there before, it will automatically expand the cleaning area; if a mole digs a hole, it will actively bypass this place. I guess the developers should be improving the program for the lawn mower robot every week, and I should give it a five-star rating soon!\" An overseas user named \"ATK\" specially uploaded the product \"working photos\" and wrote a long paragraph about his experience.\n\nQuilby from Sweden bought an Aiconic lawn mower robot produced by Greebo through a local dealer this spring. After using it several times, he is very satisfied with this product. \"My garden is relatively large, and there are some flower beds and areas that robots should not enter. We installed the RTK antenna on the roof and set the mowing range in the garden. I found that it mows very well, leaving no uncut areas, and the lawn stripes are also very beautiful.\" Quilby said.\n\nBehind the overseas users' \"buy-in\" is a series of technological innovations and breakthroughs.\n\nChen Yin, chairman of Greebo (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd., said that the company's independently developed third-generation lawn mower robot uses RTK centimeter-level satellite positioning and inertial navigation system, combined with a multi-sensor fusion system consisting of visual navigation obstacle avoidance, millimeter-wave radar and ToF depth camera, breaking through the traditional electromagnetic induction technology route. \"For example, our innovative intelligent algorithm enables the product to flexibly adjust the operation mode according to the characteristics of the site, while reducing the turf damage rate and improving energy efficiency by 30%, significantly extending the equipment life.\" Chen Yin said that direct financing from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's ChiNext has helped the company increase its investment in the research and development of AI intelligent systems. Today, Greebo has realized the operation of algorithms on the local end of the robot. Even in an environment without a network, the product can complete basic intelligent judgments such as grass seed recognition and obstacle avoidance, thereby better protecting data privacy.\n\nThe lawn mowing robots produced by Navimow Mainland, a subsidiary of Ninebot, have been exported to more than 30 countries and regions including Germany, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. \"The price of our new generation of intelligent lawn mowing robots Segway Navimow X series is much lower than the cost of traditional manual mowing in a year, saving users a lot of mowing costs.\" Li Ke, public relations manager of Ninebot, told reporters that the R&D team has significantly improved the positioning accuracy, mowing efficiency, and operation stability of the machine through technical innovations such as increasing the machine's driving speed, increasing the width of the blade, optimizing battery performance, reducing charging time, and configuring a 300-degree three-camera VSLAM system.\n\n\"It can be said that it is the breakthroughs in technologies such as LiDAR and borderless navigation that have significantly improved the product performance of lawn mowing robots and greatly optimized the user experience. Many new lawn mowing robots now support remote control via mobile phone apps. Users can individually set mowing times and areas, and view real-time working status, maintenance reminders and other information.\" Wu Junliang said that the localization of components such as LiDAR has accelerated, reducing the cost of the entire machine and driving down product prices.\n\nPerfect industrial chain provides strong support\n\nIn 2024, the overseas revenue and sales volume of Ecovacs lawn mower robots increased by 186.7% and 271.7% year-on-year respectively; Daye Co., Ltd. completed the acquisition of Germany's AL-KO company at the beginning of this year and added a new production base in Austria; Kuma Power launched the Mini version of the garden lawn mower robot at the Global Consumer Electronics Show (CES)... Today, Chinese companies are accelerating the expansion of overseas business of lawn mower robots.\n\nAccording to Qichacha data, by the end of May, there were 177 companies whose names, business scopes, brand products or patent keywords clearly included \"mowing robots\", with a large number of related companies in Suzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changzhou and other places. In the interview, many industry insiders mentioned that the reason behind the popularity of domestic mowing robots overseas is actually the perfection of China's industrial system and the growing strength of its industrial supporting capabilities.\n\nRecently, Ying Xinsen, director of the General Manager's Office of Zhejiang Sanfeng Industrial Co., Ltd., has a busy schedule, with meetings about exports one after another. During the break, he introduced to our reporter some of the reasons why domestic lawn mower robots are popular overseas: precise positioning, obstacle avoidance perception, drive control, path planning and other technical modules are the key to the true automation and intelligence of lawn mower robots. China has excellent companies in a series of sub-sectors such as laser radar, intelligent algorithms, low-pulse motors, and multi-modal control.\n\n\"A complete industrial chain and supply chain not only allows more room for product innovation, but also makes it easier to achieve industrialization and scale after finding the right path, thereby reducing costs as soon as possible.\" Ying Xinsen said that Zhejiang Sanfeng's mowing robot is equipped with a high-performance brushless motor and an adaptive cutting system, with a positioning accuracy of centimeters, and can automatically adjust the mowing speed and path according to the area and shape of the lawn. At present, the company's main products are priced at around 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, and are actively expanding overseas markets through channels such as the Canton Fair.\n\nIn addition to relying on the domestic supply chain system, powerful cross-border e-commerce has also brought more growth points for products going overseas. For example, cross-border e-commerce such as AliExpress has the advantages of simplified cross-regional access, optimized transaction processes, and enhanced brand exposure, and is helping related companies expand their sales scope, accelerate technology upgrades, and establish brand image. \"Our products can well meet user needs in terms of precise navigation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, edge cleaning, and remote control. The overseas sales of Anker E15 and E18 lawn mowing robots exceeded 4,000 units in the first month of listing. At present, we are also actively improving the localized warehousing network and intelligent logistics system, building a multi-dimensional service system, strengthening overseas delivery capabilities, and accumulating greater development momentum.\" Zhu Fanghao said.\n\nExperts believe that the lawn mower robot is a microcosm of the continuous upward and innovative development of China's manufacturing. As China's ties with the world economy become increasingly close, there will be more and more new products like \"Made in China, best-selling around the world\"."

    "translation": "Recently, the reporter attended the biennial 2025 Munich Automation Show in Germany, and deeply felt that automation technology has become more intelligent with the support of artificial intelligence (AI), driving the continuous transformation of industrial production and management. The integrated development of AI and robotics technology has accelerated in many fields, showing a new way of working and living in the future. Many companies have launched a new generation of humanoid robots, but judging from the on-site performance, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of technology and practical application of humanoid robots.\nAutomation is the backbone of modern production and the engine of innovation. The displays of many exhibitors show that machines are increasingly taking on tasks that were considered too complex a few years ago. For example, Intrinsic, a subsidiary of Google, introduced AI into the computer numerical control machine tool market. The machine tool management solutions launched by relevant manufacturers can detect raw materials with AI-based perception technology, and use automated motion and grasping planning functions to automate the part picking and placement process. Machine operators manage processes, switch jobs and import parts through a simple interface without the need for custom fixtures and robot programming.\nMachine vision is widely used in industrial quality control and process control. There are more than 130 exhibitors from the field of machine vision and image processing at the exhibition. The organizer organized more than 40 demonstrations on robot vision, AI vision, and vision components and solutions. For vision providers, it is becoming increasingly important to provide 2D, 3D, line scan and area scan camera technologies and their suitable components. 3D visual perception sensors are becoming the key support for the new generation of intelligent hardware to achieve spatial perception and generalized operation.\nAI and digitalization are constantly pushing the boundaries of traditional automation. For example, automated solutions help save resources and reduce emissions. Intelligent systems that flexibly control processes and optimize energy consumption in real time are no longer a distant prospect. In the new field of health technology, such as laboratory automation, medical technology support and the optimization of healthcare logistics processes show that diversity and social relevance around this topic have already emerged.\nAlthough AI-based robotics is not yet available on a large scale, AI has made the use of robots simpler and more flexible. Many manufacturers have integrated generative AI into robot programming, such as through intuitive voice control, making automation solutions more accessible. Starting with collaborative robots, there are more and more robots on the market that can be used without professional knowledge.\nKuka, a supplier of intelligent automation solutions, hopes to fundamentally redefine the way robots are controlled and has launched the scalable and flexibly adjustable robot operating system iiQKA.OS2. This software and controller platform combines artificial intelligence with a visual system to make robots more flexible without the need for complex programming. Kuka has also worked with Microsoft to develop an AI chatbot that converts natural language commands into program code. In addition, Kuka hopes to pave a relatively economical path for digital production for small and medium-sized enterprises through a new cloud platform.\nJapanese robot manufacturer Yaskawa Electric demonstrated the concept of \"dynamic safety zone\". The robot can operate without protective fences and ensure safety and high productivity. Only when people really approach the working area will the relevant software dynamically adjust the robot's movement, reduce speed or stop operation.\nAt the exhibition, German startup NEURA Robotics launched its humanoid robot 4NE1 Gen 3. According to reports, the robot is nearly 1.8 meters tall, can lift up to 100 kilograms, has advanced AI technology and 360-degree all-round perception, and can safely collaborate with humans without a safety cage. This robot, designed for home, workplace, and service environments, is scheduled to be available later this year. NEURA's ambitious goal is to deliver 5 million robots by 2030.\nAt the same time, with the support of Vodafone, SAP and NVIDIA, NEURA launched an open software platform. It is not only used to connect robots, but also to develop, distribute and deploy robot applications through the application store. In this open robot ecosystem, robots can share their experience learned from actual use cases. Developers imagine what a robot can do, and other robots can follow suit. Relevant participants can contribute and sell their own modules and applications.\nHumanoid robots can provide new impetus for automation in the manufacturing industry. As technology advances, these robots will become more and more attractive to manufacturers. German automakers are already actively researching this issue. BMW is testing technology from the American humanoid robot company Figure at its Spartanburg plant in California, USA. Mercedes-Benz is also using the Apollo humanoid robot from the American supplier Apptronik at its Digital Production Innovation Center in Berlin. However, as of now, there are still many challenges associated with the relatively new technology of humanoid robots in practical applications.\nAt the exhibition, Chinese robot manufacturers such as Estun, Kuka and Siasun displayed their products and technologies on a large scale. An exhibitor from Estun told Science and Technology Daily that Estun's robots have been put into battery assembly at the CATL factory in Erfurt, Germany. Through vertically integrated supply chains and highly automated operations, Estun can provide robots in a very economical way.\nChina has been the world's largest robot market since 2014. In recent years, half of the robots sold worldwide have been installed in China. In the humanoid robot supply chain, more than half of the listed companies are from China. German startups also source components such as robotic arms and joints with built-in force sensors from China. This shows that China has become a heavyweight global player in the field of robotics and AI and is expected to play an important role in shaping the future of intelligent robots.\nHowever, German media believes that Chinese robot manufacturers still have a long way to go to enter the German and European markets. Chinese manufacturers also need to learn and understand local standards and dispel users' doubts about the reliability of local services. In addition, artificial intelligence is strictly regulated in Germany and Europe. For humanoid robots, there are still many unresolved issues, and people still have many reservations about data security issues."

Please stay tuned.\n\nThe whistle blew, and the \"striker\" who took the free kick kicked decisively. The football drew a beautiful \"crescent-shaped scimitar\", passed the \"human wall\" and went straight to the far corner of the goal to score... This scene did not come from the FIFA Club World Cup on the other side of the ocean, but from the robot football field in Yizhuang, Beijing. The \"players\" responsible for free kicks and defense are all robots developed by the Chinese team.\n\"Last year, the robot could only kick the ball 15 centimeters high; now, the robot can complete a complete and beautiful free throw. This is a reflection of the rapid progress of robotics technology in recent years.\" On June 17, at the \"Vibrant China Research Tour\" Beijing theme interview event, Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Beijing Accelerated Evolution Technology Co., Ltd., introduced the company's latest achievements.\n\nThe \"Robot World\" located in Building 47 of Yizhuang Robot Industrial Park is a full-category robot exhibition center.
