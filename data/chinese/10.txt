translation: On July 8, Hangzhou Yunshenchu ​​Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Yunshenchu ​​Technology) announced the completion of a new round of financing of nearly RMB 500 million. This round of financing was jointly led by Dachen Capital and Guoxin Fund, followed by Beijing Robot Industry Development Investment Fund, Qianhai Mother Fund, CCTV Media Integration Fund, Fuzhe Fund, Huaying Capital, Wuchan Zhongda Investment and other institutions, and old shareholders such as Junshan Capital, Fanguang Capital and Aisidi Zhicheng Fund continued to support.

Yunshenchu ​​Technology was founded in 2017. In 2018, it launched a quadruped robot that can go up and down stairs, autonomously navigate, and intelligently interact. In 2019, it released a quadruped robot with autonomous charging capabilities. The company is committed to expanding the boundaries of embodied intelligent robot technology and applications. With continuous breakthroughs in technology research and development and scene implementation, it has rapidly grown into one of the "Six Little Dragons of Hangzhou" that has attracted much attention in the industry, and has become a new force in the globalization of "Chinese Intelligent Manufacturing".
Since its establishment, Yunshenchu ​​Technology has been focusing on independent research and development, lean production, global sales and professional services of humanoid robots, quadruped robots and their core components, and has achieved the implementation of 600+ industry scenarios, and has been widely used in B-side application fields such as power inspection and emergency rescue. At present, the company has more than 100 authorized patents, including more than 20 authorized invention patents.

In April this year, Yunshenchu ​​Technology released the Bobcat M20, a wheeled-legged robot designed for industrial applications in complex terrain and dangerous environments. It combines the speed of a wheeled robot with the flexibility of a legged robot, weighs 33kg, and can be carried by one person. It has an IP66 protection level, can operate normally in a temperature range of -20℃ to 55℃, can climb 80cm high platforms, and supports autonomous perception, autonomous navigation, and omnidirectional obstacle avoidance.

With its advanced AI motion control algorithm, the Bobcat M20 can autonomously adjust its movement posture and calmly cope with extreme operating environments such as bumpy mountain roads, muddy wetlands, and ruins obstacles, achieving full-domain operations and breaking through application boundaries. With the release of the Bobcat M20, Yunshenchu ​​Technology will develop embodied intelligent industry applications in power inspection, fire emergency, logistics distribution, scientific research and exploration, and more scenarios.
Regarding this round of financing, Zhu Qiuguo, founder and CEO of Yunshenchu ​​Technology, said: "The global embodied intelligence industry is currently experiencing explosive growth opportunities. The successful completion of this round of financing fully reflects the capital market's recognition of Yunshenchu's technology route and commercial prospects, and also marks that the company's development has entered a new stage of large-scale mass production."

The new round of financing will provide greater momentum for Yunshenchu ​​Technology in technology and product research and development, scenario application and expansion, talent introduction and team building, further consolidate its leading position in the field of quadruped robots, and accelerate the commercialization of its new products such as humanoid robots and wheeled robots.

In 2025, the global robotics industry is at a critical juncture in the transition from "technical verification" to "large-scale implementation". Yunshenchu ​​Technology will adhere to the dual-wheel drive development strategy of "independent innovation + industrial implementation", focus on strengthening its competitive advantages in key technology fields such as core components, motion control, environmental perception, and human-computer interaction, and strive to promote continuous breakthroughs in China's quadruped/humanoid robot technology, maintain the international frontier level in the field of intelligent robots, and achieve more "from 0 to 1" technological innovations and "from 1 to N" scene implementation.
