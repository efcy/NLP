translation: 　At 10 a.m. on March 28, the production workshop of Chengdu Canopus Robotics Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Canopus") was busy. Batches of blue robots were arranged in an orderly manner, and workers assembled and debugged them one by one.

　　Not far away, in the Chengdu Robotics Innovation Center, robots from major brands such as Yaskawa, Fanuc, Siemens, Estun, and Canopus are readily available. Hundreds of college students from the School of Information Engineering came here to participate in a practical training course on industrial robots. Focusing on the industrial application of large models of artificial intelligence, 15 training rooms and about 500 training stations are set up here. The industrial robot and intelligent manufacturing exhibition center of the base can be open to enterprises, schools and social groups. It is committed to providing robot application innovation research and high-skilled industrial talent training model innovation for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, promoting technological innovation, achievement transformation, industrial incubation and talent training, and accelerating the formation of new quality productivity.

　　Intelligent assembly realizes mass production of "robots making robots"

　　Walking into the Canopus production workshop in Chengdu Robot Industrial Park, various industrial robots are waving their arms and turning non-stop to inspect each process before leaving the factory. More than 60 types of robots are produced here. In the exhibition hall, blue robots are neatly arranged, and they are smoothly performing fast grasping and precise operation demonstrations at designated locations... like professional and careful workers, but unlike humans, "these workers" can work continuously for 24 hours.

　　"In the field of industrial manufacturing, industrial robots have long become an indispensable assistant." Deng Shihai, deputy general manager of Canopus, told reporters that the current application areas of industrial robots have covered industries such as automobiles, electronics, metallurgy, light industry, petrochemicals, and medicine, and are widely used in spraying, welding, handling, stacking, polishing and grinding.

　　When the company was founded in 2012, it aspired to be the "pioneer of Chinese robots". The outstanding performance of the company's products in the field of welding has attracted much attention and it is known as the "mechanical welding general". Canopus is not only at the forefront of the welding field, but also has outstanding performance in general industry, automobile industry, new energy industry, electronics industry, consumer goods industry and other fields. Among them, the automotive intelligent manufacturing robot adopts self-developed control system and process software system, which has reached the industry-leading level and can meet various welding conditions such as steel spot welding and aluminum spot welding on the automobile manufacturing production line. "The company adopts the intelligent robot assembly mode and has realized mass production of 'robots making robots'."

　　With its leading technology, Canopus has accelerated the expansion of its global business. Deng Shihai told reporters that Canopus's industrial robot sales in the European market doubled last year, while the sales in the American market reached a breakthrough. Today, Canopus has customers in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and its products have been sold in four major foreign markets: South Asia, Southeast Asia, America and Europe.

　　Independently developed industrial humanoid robot demo to be launched within this year

　　As a "hidden champion" in the industrial robot welding segment, Canopus attaches particular importance to the four words "independent research and development".

　　"The scientific research team is the largest department in the company, with more than 100 people, accounting for more than one-third of the total staff." Deng Shihai told reporters that in the more than 10 years since its establishment, Canopus has continuously polished its core technology, dug deep into the application of industrial robots in specific scenarios, and iterated its products. In terms of R&D strength, it has a "R&D team" of more than 100 people covering software, electronics, electricity, machinery, sensing, scenarios, etc. The core R&D personnel of the team have been engaged in research in the field of robot control systems for nearly 20 years. At the same time, Canopus maintains a high level of R&D investment, with funds accounting for about 15% of its revenue, and in some years the proportion even reaches 20%. With the deepening of independent research and development, it has participated in the formulation of more than 10 national standards for industrial robots, and has also jointly conducted school-enterprise training for students with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan University and some vocational colleges in Sichuan.

　　With the continuous increase in R&D investment, Canopus, which was born in Chenghua District, has grown from 5 people in its early days to a national-level "little giant" enterprise with specialization and innovation in more than 10 years. At present, the independently developed robots cover more than 60 types such as welding, handling, and assembly. The product applications cover more than 80% of industrial scenarios, with more than 400 valid intellectual property rights and an annual output value of more than 300 million yuan.

　　"Since 2023, we have launched a new product almost every month, and our production and sales have increased significantly." Speaking of future product planning, Deng Shihai revealed that it is expected to launch an industrial humanoid robot Demo within the year and strive to achieve practical application in 1-2 vertical industrial scenarios.

　　More than 70 artificial intelligence companies gather in the park

　　While cultivating local smart manufacturing companies such as Canopus, Chenghua Economic Development Zone has set its sights on the long term. The park has attracted and nurtured the best along the upstream and downstream of the robot industry chain, gathering more than 70 artificial intelligence industry-related companies, and the smart manufacturing industry ecosystem and smart economic industry cluster have begun to take shape. The establishment of the Chengdu Robotics Innovation Center has undoubtedly added an important "puzzle piece" to the park's construction of a robot-specific industry ecosystem.

　　The reporter learned that the park has introduced the leading intelligent manufacturing enterprise, Innovation AChi Technology Group Co., Ltd., and the two parties have jointly built an integrated production, education and research platform - Chengdu Robot Innovation Center. Since it was officially put into use on March 6, 2024, it has successfully attracted FANUC, Yaskawa and other leading robot companies with global influence to settle in, and jointly with Sichuan University, Chengdu Industry and Trade Vocational and Technical College, Canopus, National Robot Testing and Assessment Center, etc., to jointly build an urban robot industry-education consortium.

　　On March 26, at the signing ceremony of the "Robot+" technology achievement promotion and transformation of the Science and Technology Innovation Tianfu and Zhihui Chengdu and the "Liyuan Manyuan" project of Chengdu Chenghua Economic Development Zone in 2025, the Chengdu Robot Industry-Education Consortium released a list of "Robot+" industry-university-research-application cooperation needs on behalf of 30 key robot companies, showing 42 enterprise technology research and development needs, 40 high-end talent needs, and 37 application cooperation needs. The University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Chengdu University of Technology released a list of 51 "Robot+" technology achievement transformations on site, covering robots, intelligent production lines, automated testing and other fields. With the development and growth of the consortium, a new pattern of robot industry development with mutual empowerment between upstream and downstream of the industrial chain and symbiosis and integration of industrial ecology is accelerating. At the event, Chenghua District and representatives of 14 companies including Hebao Robotics and Guoxing Intelligent signed 7 robot industrialization projects and 7 robot scientific and technological achievement transformation projects on the spot, including humanoid robots, special firefighting robots, special underwater robots, AI large language models and other "robot +" R&D centers and manufacturing projects, with a total investment of about 7 billion yuan, which will bring strong momentum to Chenghua District to promote the high-quality development of the intelligent manufacturing industry.
